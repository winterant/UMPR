When I saw they would be showing infamous eggs of the House of Faberge from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (VMFA), I knew I had to go!\n\nTucked away near the gelateria and the garden, the Gallery is pretty much hidden from view. It's what real estate agents would call \"cozy\" or \"charming\" - basically any euphemism for small.\n\nThat being said, you can still see wonderful art at a gallery of any size, so why the two *s you ask? Let me tell you:\n\n* pricing for this, while relatively inexpensive for a Las Vegas attraction, is completely over the top. For the space and the amount of art you can fit in there, it is a bit much.\n* it's not kid friendly at all. Seriously, don't bring them.\n* the security is not trained properly for the show. When the curating and design teams collaborate for exhibitions, there is a definite flow. That means visitors should view the art in a certain sequence, whether it be by historical period or cultural significance (this is how audio guides are usually developed). When I arrived in the gallery I could not tell where to start, and security was certainly not helpful. I was told to \"just look around\" and \"do whatever.\" \n\nAt such a *fine* institution, I find the lack of knowledge and respect for the art appalling.","date":"2015-04-15 05:21:16"}

My 3 year old son needed a haircut this past summer and the lure of the $7 kids cut signs got me in the door. We had to wait a few minutes as both stylists were working on people. The decor in this place is total garbage. It is so tacky. The sofa they had at the time was a pleather sofa with giant holes in it. And my son noticed ants crawling all over the floor and the furniture. It was disgusting and I should have walked out then. Actually, I should have turned around and walked out upon entering but I didn't. So the older black male stylist finishes the haircut he was doing and it's our turn. I tell him I want a #2 clipper around the back and sides and then hand cut the top into a standard boys cut. Really freaking simple, right? WRONG! Rather than use the clippers and go up to actually cut the hair, he went down. Using it moving downward doesn't cut hair, it just rubs against it. How does this man who has an alleged cosmetology license not know how to use a set of freaking clippers??? I realized almost immediately that he had no idea what he was doing. No idea at all. After about 10 minutes of watching this guy stumble through it, I said \"you know what? That's fine.\", paid and left. All I wanted to do was get out of that scummy joint and take my son to a real haircut place.\n\nBottom line: DO NOT GO HERE. RUN THE OTHER WAY!!!!!","date":"2013-12-07 03:16:52"}

We were not disappointed.\n\nI am a bit of an amateur chef myself and consider my palate to be fairly sophisticated when it comes to all kinds of South Asian cuisine. This is not authentic Indian food - we don't have rice and salad bowls - but it is good, wholesome, high quality Indian food.\n\nI ordered a bowl of rice, yellow daal and the koftas (meatballs). The daal was perfect, the way daal should be cooked. The koftas were a little bland for my taste, but otherwise not bad...soft and the right texture. Paired with the many sauces and onions and the whole dish was wholesome and rich and very filling. My friend ordered the biryani, which, while not bad, still isn't the way real biryani should be, and I come from a city known for its biryani - but then I still haven't found a single place in America that makes biryani the way they do it back home.\n\nThe ambiance is good and there's plenty of room to sit. The line moves quickly and at most you'll face a 10-15 min wait on a crowded day. The only issue I had was with the music - being a designer, it bothers me that the music selection to go with such great interiors  could have been better...I would expect Bollywood classics or Indian classical fusion instead of the usual loud pop music.\n\nTldr: if you're looking for authentically prepared and presented Indian food you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for high quality Indian-American food, this is a great place to get it. Will be coming back to try their tikka masala and chicken next.\n\nUpdate: went there again with a bunch of friends and tried their chicken tikka masala and pav bhaji.

I was hungry and Caesars Palace was a across from where I was staying and all the restaurants in my hotel were packed and had lines, I walked right in with no waiting. (I will assume now that since its Bobby's place this place can get crowded so I feel the need to note this was a Sunday about 11:45am) Once inside Caesars Palace, I went to the first restaurant I saw, which was this one.  I realized mid-meal it was his restaurant when the waiter at the table next to me was explaining to the recently seated couple that \"Mr Flay likes a little spice so beware all of our dishes have a little kick\" (they were an older couple). I know i'm slow after he said that, that's when i realized why they had his cookbooks in the front. :)  (but like i said had a horrible trip so i wasn't even looking for things like this) anyway onto the food.\n\nFOOD: fantastic.  I went on sunday and i got the eggs and aged striploin tortilla (fancy name for steak and eggs) and  it was yummy.  It came with all this spices of sorts (well they werent spices). I am not really sure how to describe it, more like the consistency of salsa's but they werent salsa's, at any rate it was really good mix with the eggs.  I had a side of home fries which were a little burnt but oh well.  The steak was very good, very flavored, moist and tender. Overall very good. Had a cappuccino too, also very good.

I don't know what the problem is - I have worked in the industry before while in college and I would say front of the house training needs big overhaul.  At any rate, they have lots of TV's and it is closer to us but just plain not good.  I wish they would switch locations with Wild Wing Cafe - also chain-y but much better food and service.","date":"2016-04-11 16:42:13"}

See, we chose not to make reservations, but instead just wing it and see where we could get in. They had some early dining availability, so we jumped on it. Their special New Year's \"Paint the Town Gold\" menu did not disappoint.\n\nLocated in the beautiful Mandalay Bay restaurant row, Kumi is a gorgeous display of style and food artistry. Every course was surprisingly delicious, and plated interestingly.\n\nService was very good, seriously on point. Right up until the dessert course...after 30 minutes of waiting for it, we finally requested the check as we had an event to get to. One of our attendants felt bad and offered to quickly grab it for us but we were in danger of being late so we opted not to take him up on it. \n\nIt's a beautiful, albeit very pricey experience for dinner. We would return for special occasions only.","date":"2017-01-02 05:24:56"}

Oh, how things have changed.\n\nThere are some goods, however.  If you are a conventioneer, you have instant and direct walking access to the main convention center.  But don't think about parking here for said conventions.  $30 a day for parking, Hilton?  Seriously?  That's robbery.  And greed.\n\nThe biggest disappointment is the killing off of Star Trek: The Experience over two years ago.  Despite this place being off-Strip, I made it a point to go here because they had such a fun and unique attraction here.  It would be one thing if they had something in mind to replace it, but either poor planning or the economy.... It's dead, Jim. \n\nThe \"Space Lounge\" is still there.  An entire casino area with a heavy sci-fi theme to it.  Except there's no casino here.  It's a huge space themed area with a ghost town bar, no slots, a few couches, a makeshift stage, beer signs, and a few remnants of Star Trek themes.  All of this space, and nothing.  No life to it.  Couches and beer signs only make the emptiness and waste of the area seem more empty and pathetic.\n\nWith their main draw gone, what has replaced it as the headliner?  Benihana's.  Nothing wrong with the restaurant, but it's hardly unique or exclusive, even in Vegas.  The Hilton has a Pizza Hut Express here too.  Maybe they should promote that as their \"big draw\" on the marquee as well.  A huge Benihana sign covers up the old entrance to Star Trek.  With couches pushed in front of the entryway.  Again, just sad, and I'll be a big man in saying that they kind of broke my heart getting rid of one of my most beloved hang-outs here.\n\nThe arcade is dead as well.  Another blanketed off space that sits and collects dust.  Again, with two-plus years, no suitable replacement has been found for anything in this section.  A few shops that fluctuate, but that's it.  This is a lot of dead space to go unused.  \n\nThere's also the issue of the Men's bathroom in the main casino area.  Above every urinal is a picture of a lust-crazed girl staring over your bits with a camera, magnifying glass, tape measure, etc, while you pee.  The first time I saw this, it was \"ha ha\" funny, then when the laughter died, it just turned creepy and weird for me.  I actually selected a urinal based off which girl creeped me out the least.  She merely looked like she was casting spells at my nethers.  I could live with that.\n\nLadies: I must know.  Is there something like this in the girl's restroom?  When you close the stall door to do your business, is there a picture of some crazed guy making grabbing motions where your boobs would be?  Please message me and let me know.  I'd really like to know what the Hell you get in your bathroom after my gender's discovery.\n\nAs critical as I am being, there looks to be some sort of steampunk-themed club called \"Triumph\" there.  I want to check this out.  Atonement for the death of my beloved Warp Core Breach booze bowl?  We'll see, but it's going to have to be pretty good to replace the hole in my heart from that much booze for so cheap a price.\n\nThe sad part is, Hilton's one of those \"history rich\" casinos here.  Look up the history on this place.  A lot of awesome stars and vintage Vegas stuff happened here, which makes you wonder why this isn't represented more.\n\nThis place is great for convention visitors to stay, but that's about it as far as I can see.  They need to figure themselves out for everything else.","date":"2011-01-09 00:09:50"}

I went to Huntersville Ford yesterday to get an oil change on my commuter car.  Paid my $41.00 and was given back my car just over an hour later.\nToday I had to go to work (40 mile round trip commute).  As I was getting off of I-85, I noticed the smell of burning oil.  I thought maybe the tech just spilled a little on the exhaust manifold since it's right there, and maybe it's burning off.  I didn't hit a stop light until I was almost at my office.  When I stopped and was waiting for the light, my cabin started to fill with smoke, and I had smoke pouring out from under the hood and the wheel wells as well.\nI pulled over into the parking area of a gas station (because they have accessible fire extinguishers) and parked.  I popped the hood only to find THE TECHNICIAN DID NOT PUT THE OIL FILLER CAP BACK ON!!!  Now my engine is covered in potentially flammable oil, and of course Huntersville Ford is closed today!!!!\nI have my car sitting outside in the parking lot with the hood open, just in case it decides to ignite, because my engine is pretty hot after a 20 mile drive.\nI called and left a voicemail, and now I have to find a way to degrease my engine at work, just so I can drive it home in a less-flammable state.  I WILL HOLD HUNTERSVILLE FORD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY COMPONENTS THAT FAIL AS OF A RESULT OF THIS.  Most electronics don't like being slathered in motor oil.  In fact, I'm pretty sure they aren't designed for that.\n\nAnd NO, I did not have other work done... Just the oil change.  You had 1 job.... oil change.

This time, I ordered the following - duck crepe (SOOOO good!), shrimp tamale (very flavorful and fresh), salmon (mediocre, at best... and our waiter even told us not to order it... but my friend didn't listen), and halibut (tender, flaky, not fishy at all... and so flavorful!).  The halibut and appetizers were my favorites and I would definitely go and order those again.  We also ordered 3 desserts, which were totally worth it!  Sweet potato pudding (and I don't even like sweet potatoes!), Banana pie tart thingy, and spicy peanut chocolate cake.  mmmmmm would definitely go there for dessert and the appetizers!!! \n\nYou need a reservation for this place.","date":"2012-11-06 06:00:13"}

My daughter's go to is a strawberry banana smoothie and the menu had a few smoothies that had strawberry and banana mixed with other stuff and I asked if they would be able to make one with just strawberry and banana and she had said they couldn't because it was already pre made. So we continued to look at the menu and a different girl came and said she would be able to make the smoothie so thank you to her. My husband and I knew we wanted to get an acai bowl so as\nwe looked at the different options we found one we wanted to try but on the menu it had a pitaya and we asked if we could get it with acai instead but again was told that it was already pre made. So we went with one that was made with acai but it had blueberries which we don't like and we weee hesistant to ask if they would be able to leave them out since everything seemed to be pre made but my husband did ask and luckily she said they could leave it out. Whew! It wasn't a long wait to get our order. My daughter drank her smoothie saying it was okay and our acai bowl was okay as well. To\nme the best part was the granola and that's about it.

Every restaurant was packed before the show, so we set on wandering MGM afterwards for a good after show nosh and were definitely pleased at Crush. Luckily we were seated right away (not many people ordering dinner at 11pm I suppose!) and our incredibly nice server saw to our drink order ASAP.\n\nThe ambience is tres chic. Dark, romantic, and removed from casino craziness in the back where we sat cuddled up in a booth. The only negative about our seats was the pretty chilly draft, but perhaps we were just too sober ;) The Syrah was absolutely delicious, and at $11 for a glass, a Vegas bargain. We began with the Caesar salad which came out within minutes of ordering and was very tasty, though I myself found the sweetness to be a little strange. Overall it was a crunchy, refreshing delight. We then shared a margherita flatbread and the gnocchi. Whoa....both dishes definitely exceeded expectations. They were small plates, but really perfect for sharing. The speed at which the salad was delivered was slightly misleading, as the other dishes took quite a while to come out. However, they were clearly exceptionally fresh when they arrived.\n\nOur waiter was pretty busy but as attentive as he could be, and very professional without being overbearing. The end-to-end experience was more than I expected at such a large venue, and thus deserves a high recommendation. This was a perfect way to wind down from an energizing show without losing the dazzle of a getaway weekend with your honey.","date":"2014-08-10 23:03:05"}

To sum it up, the experience was so darn good that I wish I had more time on the plane.","date":"2010-01-08 09:36:25"}

I won't deny my dog needed some serious grooming.  We'd brushed him out the night before but he could still use more combing, his hind legs\/butt trimmed up and he had some matts behind his ear.  There are 4 doors at this place, I believe. If you just pull in to the drive way it's not terribly clear until you get closer to the doors and see signs directing you which to go into.  The lobby is cute. I was quickly greeted and I was given a form to complete. The woman doing the grooming introduced herself and I asked that his hind legs and butt get trimmed up and asked that she cut out any matts.  She said it would probably take about 3 hours.  I received a text about 3 1\/2 hours later stating the price would be $80 and if I returned within 8 weeks it would be $65.  I went to pick him up and I was shocked that they shaved him.  His hair was NOT that bad.  Not to mention the hair that was left was not soft as it has been after visiting other groomers.  I didn't say anything because I was so shocked in the moment so I took him home.  We saw our dog paying particular attention to his private area...more so than he usually does.  My husband looked closer and found that he had been nicked a couple of times.  We found a large cut behind one of his ears.  We won't be returning.","date":"2016-03-07 00:34:42"}

This review was tough to give, as it could've been anywhere between 2 and 4 stars.\n\nLet's start with the positives. I came here with a friend for Summerlicious this afternoon at 12:30, and we got the last seat in the restaurant (it helped that we reserved). We were given the menu and our order was taken in about 3-4 minutes. Not bad to start.\n\nI ordered the miso soup, green salad, ebi shiumai, sushi\/sashimi\/maki, and green tea ice cream. The miso soup and green salad tasted nothing special (the soup was a little salty though). The ebi shiumai tasted really good! The sushi\/sashimi\/maki tasted very good as well, and I especially love how there's a much higher raw fish-rice ratio compared to other restaurants I go to. Finally, the green tea ice cream was a great dessert to finish.\n\nEverything with the food satisfied me. The service, after having the order taken, was a near disaster. I understand it was a busy day today due to the fact it was a nice Friday, but many of the servers were confused in their roles. There was a long lineup of orders by the sushi counter, and at one point I saw 15 dishes lining up ready for serving, but no servers were going to pick them up. I didn't receive my shiumai until 1:00, and my sushi\/sashimi\/maki until around 1:20. I finished everything by around 1:30, but the ice cream didn't come until around 1:40, and finally the bill didn't come till around 1:55. After 1 hour and 35 minutes, I finally left the restaurant at 2:05, since I had to ask for the credit card machine, in which no server was around for about 8 minutes before I finally got one's attention.\n\nWhat probably saved this from a 2-star (or even a 1-star rating) was the fact the manager came out to me as I was signing my receipt saying how they were horribly understaffed and completely underestimated the demand for Summerlicious this year. They only had two sushi chefs, four servers, and two chefs serving what was a full house restaurant. In a way I felt bad, but I did give them just less than 10% tips; something I almost never do in restaurant.\n\nFree wifi! Password is the phone number. Perhaps as a sucker for free wifi that might have contributed to the 3-star rating I gave. However, be warned.","date":"2013-07-13 00:57:45"}

I ordered the hangover burger, and they not only asked how I wanted my burger (can choose from medium to well-done) but the worker even asked how runny I wanted the fried egg and then if I wanted it sunny side up or if they should flip it over easy. My buddy asked for mustard, and they even asked whether he wanted regular yellow, dijon, whole grain, or honey mustard. I added sweet potato fries for the $1 upcharge because I love sweet potato fries, paid my $10 and waited. I must say I was a little disappointed that I had to wait 15 minutes for the burger, but after first bite I had no more complaints!\nI don't know what's in Pat LaFreida's beef mixture, but it was the highest quality beef in a burger I've ever ordered. The bun was ridiculously soft as well. The egg was cooked perfectly, but the burger lacked any flavor from the small slice of cheese or the bacon hash unfortunately. Despite that, the amazing quality still made this burger awesome. \nThe sweet potato fries were by far the best sweet potato fries I've ever eaten, and I love sweet potato fries so that says a lot. They were crispy which so many places cannot accomplish and had a balance of sweetness from the fries and salt that was perfect. They came with a decent maple sauce, but I didn't dip very many because they were honestly better on their own. I must say, the bang bang sauce that comes on the side of the burgers is incredible though. It's similar to a Thousand Island dressing without the pickle relish, but something about it just makes it so much better and slightly sweeter. \nOverall, I probably wouldn't order the hangover again and would choose a more flavorful\/interesting option. I would also recommend going with a double if you're hungry because each patty is only around 4 ounces. Despite these slight \"drawbacks\", the quality of the meat and bun stood out so much that I think any burger here would be amazing and for a pretty solid price as well.","date":"2015-06-08 18:56:14"}

I blame the Marriot for most of the mess but the City of Tempe need to plan better for events.\nInside the stadium I found the place to be less than average for Spring Training games.  The food was not good, the customer service was average and we could not hear the speakers very well.  I will stick to other Spring Training facilities to see some games in the future.","date":"2014-04-01 02:10:32"}

I went in, placed my order, and after about 15 minutes, was on my way home. \n\nThe inside is cozy, there is a new hookah lounge upstairs (not technically the same business), for those who might be interested in that. The tables inside were pretty low key, but the kitchen area is open except for some glass, so you get to watch your food prepared while you wait which is always a nice touch. Some people don't like that, but I do, it forces restaurants to practice more hygienic practices because customers can see more. \n\nThe young lady who rang me up was helpful and friendly. The gentleman who gave me my food, apologized for the wait (15 minutes is not long in my book, but maybe for some it is), and said that calling ahead is a great option if you're ever in a hurry in the future. \n\nI ordered a lamb and chicken shish kabob. They were both DELICIOUS. Many kabobs in this city are incredibly bland and under seasoned, definitely not the case here. The rice was also well flavored. The green sauce that was at the counter where you pick up your food was perfectly spiced and I put it on EVERYTHING! I appreciate the fresh lemon wedge that was included in my to-go container. \n\nMy only real complaint was the price. It was more than $17 for two kabobs, which I thought was on the expensive side. If they took their prices down around $2, I'd be here way more often that is good for my wallet...","date":"2016-03-06 23:58:31"}

The prime rib was balanced with just the perfect amount of richness and seasoning. I ordered a medium and it was a true medium- the edges were seasoned and done well while the interior was still a soft pink and juicy. My date loved the Yorkshire pudding, I wasn't really a fan, but it was airy and puffed up to perfection. The mushrooms were rich and earthy, the perfect accompaniment. The mashed potatoes were smooth, creamy, and deliciously well seasoned. No bland taters here.\n\nAll in all, we had a truly wonderful evening at Lawry's LV. We decided to skip dessert because we were stuffed and totally satisfied, so our waiter went the extra mile and boxed up a mini cake for us saying that we couldn't leave without something sweet on our anniversary (!!)

When I objected to being relegated to reading with one eye with my new glasses, the reply was...\"Well, then you'll have to see the Dr. again, and no, he is not available now.\"  No offer to look up his schedule and see when I could see him again, or see if another Dr. could see me then to resolve it.  After the poor response to the problem (you would think they would have some professional way to deal with when glasses come back from the mfr\/lens maker and there is an unexpected issue).  I told them I'm not a patient here any longer and took my useless glasses home and resolved to find a quality optometry office and start over.

So I called again and toild them to toss my file out and not contact me again for any future appts. \n Another thing about their exams.....as part of your exam, they offer to take optional (extra cost) retina photos so you can also have a look at your retinas on a computer screen with the Dr., using a clumsy cube-shaped camera. You sit there and they have you smush your face up against a flat glass panel on the front while they take repeated attempts to get a good photo of your retina. They charge extra if you want this option. Then they raised the price, and I declined due to raising the price. They were charging plenty for that option already.  I moved to a different office that does not charge anything extra at all for the retina photos, and uses a better camera than the camera cube, so no more smushing my face against a flat glass window.\n(Note: using fake name here for privacy protection from internet identity thieves.)","date":"2018-07-17 00:21:32"}

Everything from start to finish was pretty much impeccable. \n\nSourdough bread in the shape of leaves were brought out immediately with softened butter in a small ramekin.  One thing I hate is when warm bread is brought out with butter that is ice cold and hard to spread on the bread, so I really appreciated that the butter was the right temperature to easily spread.\n\nFor a starter, we split the Terrine of foie gras which was delicious.  It has a thin layer of braised beef ground down to a coarse pate texture, then a thin layer of foie gras, then a layer of prune gelee.  Served with crostini and a small frisee salad.  The slightly slightly saltier beef and the creamy foie went so well together. The prune gelee added that touch of cool sweetness that made it all work together.  A dish I would definitely recommend.\n\nFor our entrees, I got the Steak frites, and Mark H had the Leg of lamb (Gigot d'Agneau.)  Mine was hangar steak topped with caramelized onions served with a compound butter and a healthy portion of nicely crispy, thinly cut fries.  The steak was cooked to a perfect mid rare and was tender.  The onions and the compound butter did overpower the steak a bit, though.\n\nMark H's dish on the other hand, was the better of the two.  The roasted leg of lamb was just so tender and flavorful,  the knife cut through the meat like butter.  The lamb was served with flageolet beans and braised escarole.  Our server asked him when he was ordering if he wanted any sides to go with it since it didn't come with a starch but the beans and escarole was enough for an entree portion.  Besides, I know he wanted to save room for dessert.\n\nFor dessert, we split the Banana crepe gateau.  Layers of crepes with banana pastry cream between them, served with salted caramel and french vanilla gelato.   This was pretty amazing as well.  I've had some fantasic gateau de crepes in france and this one really reminded me of being there.  The banana flavor was a bit too subtle for me but that salted caramel was like heaven.  Such an incredible texture to it with that bright kick of salt, damn.  The french vanilla gelato was memorable as well.  Nice silky texture and oh so creamy.\n\nThe next time I'm there,  we really have to try their breakfast.","date":"2016-01-04 04:06:15"}

The salmon salad came with a huge piece of fresh, healthy tasting salmon filet. It was just what I wanted. \n\nThe one wrinkle was that I wanted to swap something out of my salad for avocado instead (which came with the grilled shrimp salad but I wanted salmon, and not shrimp). The server told me they didn't do \"those kinds of substitutions\" but would check anyway. He came back, and affirmed that they couldn't put avocado on my salad unless they charged an extra $2.00. Kind of annoying. I get that if you're Terroni you can have a \"no substitutions\" policy but in this case, how about changing that policy? \n\nThe server really made an effort though, and said he'd bring over some guacamole instead. That was much appreciated :) \n\nThe hourly rentals to use the pool and ping pong tables are pretty pricey ($25\/hour) but it is a really nice space now, with nice, clean washrooms (important!), comfy seats, and lots of TVs.

Good taste, good variety on the menu, priced fair. Why does it take so long to put in my dinner order? If I have been there 5-7 times, I have had to wait to order too long maybe 5 times.

The original location was at about 52nd McDowell(it was a treat after squaw peak hike with da)( but they have been at the current location for probably the last 20 years. They have a good mix of North Indian and South Indian food. Masala dosas have always been one of my favorites things to get. The vegies and sambar are always fresh as well. The title may not say it here but they are just as famous for all the amazing sweets they make as well. Indians from all over town order it by the tray but if you arent sure what you want to order ask them to sample it. Jalebi barfi and laddu are some of my go to's.

You'll see an crowd of ASU kids definitely during cricket matches but they also have indian music videos playing throughout the day. Before I forget my favorite thing to get from there to go is pani puri!. Picture a cracker like hollow bubble with potatoes chickpeas and a spicy sauce. yes my mouth is watering just describing it.

Having tried two of the pastas and the gnocchi, my impression is that these dishes are the food version of jazz improv - discordant and overwhelming.  Like the music, I can see how the Pasta Bar dishes may appeal to many, particularly those who favor flavor intensity and\/or creativity over all else.  For my taste buds, this was overload.  Interesting yes, but I can't say I found it good.\nHere are some details:  \nPasta and gnocchi - both are quite heavy and substantial.  I prefer a more tender pasta and pillow-light gnocchi.  Maybe after running a marathon the high-density pasta would hold more appeal.\nSauces - Here is the in-your-face part.  The gnocchi sauce is spicy, overwhelmingly so for me (although I do freely admit to being a hot chili wimp).  Despite my personal intolerance to hot food, a more delicate approach would have been better.\nThe le Sarde sauce sounded interesting, mainly because I love sardines, but my taste buds could not get over the bizarre combination of strong flavors vying for attention. I could not even pick out the taste of the sardines amongst the culinary noise.  And what is with the dried hunks of bread?  I could not get beyond the oddness of this one.  \nThe carbonara was an intense combination of garlic and black pepper flavors, and probably the dish I enjoyed most of the three.  Even on this one, the garlic was out of this world in intensity.\nOn the good side, the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic - a real treat.  The atmosphere is modern and hip, while maintaining a touch of coziness.  The ingredients all appeared fresh and high quality.  And the food is indeed interesting - this is no boring spaghetti\/lasagna place.\nAs a matter of taste, I'm going to have to pass on Pasta Bar.  For the price, I'll be looking for more of a flavor symphony.  If culinary improv and high-density pasta is your thing, check it out.","date":"2009-03-01 19:50:23"}

You know you're at home, but someone's moved something, rearranged the furniture, or otherwise changed things ever so slightly but just enough to make you suspicious. This wasn't the Epicure Cafe that I remember from three or four years ago.\n\nI learned from Jackie, our cutesy server who was a total dupe for actress Clea DuVall, that a few years ago Epicure changed locations. To a few doors down farther east on Queen, on the same side of the street. Which explains the slightly-different-but-not-quite layout, decor and seating. It was a pleasant surprise. I didn't venture upstairs but I was told there's an outdoor eating area that will have to be explored on my next visit.\n\nThe menu options are, like others have said, a bit overwhelming. But for the fussy eater (I was with one of them) there was no lack of choice - Epicure has everything from pasta (17 choices, including different sauces and shapes), burgers, pizza, wraps and another full page of duck\/veal\/lamb\/chicken options. I appreciate the selection but it could stand to be honed a little! Luckily Jackie was able to recommend favourites when we showed indecision. \n\nMy eyes went straight for the Pumpkin Ravioi ($14), which I was assured was \"not a mistake\". And it wasn't. I barely looked up my from my plate as I feasted my eyes on the glorious, pillowy ravioli on my plate. They were seasoned with ginger and nutmeg, tossed in parmesan cream sauce with grilled corn, wilted spinach and mushrooms. The mushrooms were perfectly sauteed, the spinach was wilted just right and the corn was fresh and added the exact amount of crunch that the dish needed. The portion wasn't skimpy either - at some restaurants when you order jumbo ravioli you get 3-4 pieces, but this was more than double the size. Good value for the money.\n\nI was more than tempted by the dessert board (tartufo, ice cream, tiramisu, Grand Marnier cheesecake or crème caramel, Belgian chocolate mousse, apple crumble) but unfortunately dinner left me positively STUFFED. After seeing that Epicure is now open until 1 or 2am every night I know where I'll be heading for late night dessert!","date":"2009-05-20 03:22:43"}

Especially when it just hits the table, it'll have you scratching your head. Once it cools, the \"meat\" starts to get a bit of texture, but it still pretty great. If you have the thing and you can't do textures, you're probably safer sticking to something with veggies instead.\n\nAll the food I've had here has been really great, even if the service is a little shoddy. Don't let that deter you. \n\nGet the bun roll.\n\nI'm serious.","date":"2015-01-18 18:39:41"}

The penne san remo is supposed to contain artichoke but we only found two chunks of artichoke out of a container with enough food to feed 3 people. So that was disappointing. The sauce was also really bland and the chicken was overcooked\/rubbery. The stuffed shells were ok, no major issues, they just weren't worth the price.

Their pickles are actually spicy. They seems to be lightly dusted with some kind of chile powder. A nice kick follows a good bite.\n\nI ordered the Dilly something or other. It was half a sandwich (sub or panini) with a bowl of soup. I chose the Corn and Green Chile Bisque with the Sausalito Bandito panini. Delish! It also passed my spicy- enough- for- me- test. Yes, I needed multiple napkins for my nose.\nI could have taken a little more spice, so next time I might ask them to kick it up a notch, but it was a refreshing foray back to my traveling days when I tried to convince a chef in India that, no, I am actually not white. I just have REALLY light skin. Never worked.\n\nAl had the Aztec pizzeti. Coming from NY, I am particular about pizza. This looked like it fit the bill. Very think and crispy crust. A little too much cheese for my taste, but most people out here like it like that. She loved it, along with her bowl of loaded potato soup.\n\nMickey had the Gobbler with a side salad.

I got here at 3:12, sat at the bar by the tv's and then proceeded to wait for a hello or a welcome that didn't happen until finally about two minutes later. I ask about the happy hour to which the woman working responded they don't have a happy hour since they are running specials. I'm a little sad about the happy hour thing being scratched off but I have had The Otheroom to go before and was pleased with the food so I decided to look at the menu and order something good. I then wait about ten minutes before being approached and the whole time I was sitting there was a guy making drinks and nothing else. How can they have only one bartender? It's slow but it's also Memorial Day weekend and you should have enough people working. I understand people want to split your tab and whatever else but there was a third guy who could have handled whatever problem they had at the register. Anyways back to when the woman came to me she apologized for the wait which I didn't care for at that point and proceeded to order my food. Overall the experience I was expecting wasn't a good one. The food was great and a bar with great food but when the service isn't up to par it deserves a low rating. I work in high end retail and know me and many of my co workers and friends around the mall would like to be treated just like any other customer and be given a great service when we go to eat for our lunches.

We bought an air-conditioner from them in 2014 and one just last summer in 2015.  We've had nothing but problems since the very first day we had it installed.  Not only that, but the guy who comes out is completely rude and his office seems to back him up.  This is a unit which holds 5-tons of Puron so it is pretty big and it's not cheap.  We spent $5000 on the unit and it is still under warranty.  It's a good thing, too, because these people have had to replace it once and now it's compressor just blew yesterday morning.  It had been making horrible noises and shutting down and about a week ago, they came out and replaced the thermostat and the air seemed to work, but it was making an even more horrible noise than before and then 2 nights ago it stopped working altogether again.  So, it just so happens that my roommate was going to call them yesterday, anyway, to come out and fix it AGAIN.  However, before he did, all of a sudden, I heard the loudest BOOM!  I mean, it was like a bomb going off and literally was louder than a shotgun being fired close by.  Then, it had this awful constant noise - like I've never heard before and vapor was coming out of the hose by the valve and there was a funny smell and I didn't know what was going on and I panicked because I wasn't sure if it was smoke or Puron or what so I ran into the house, turned off all of the units, made sure all of our cats were okay and ran back outside real quick with fire-extinguishers just in case it was smoke.  My roommate called them and they said they'd be there within the hour.  Two hours later, a little after noon, the guy shows up and says it's the compressor that totally blew and he'd have to order another one and that they were going to charge $1200 for labor for the 5-hour job it was going to take to do it.  The compressor, itself, is still under warranty.  He tried to say that the problem was our faulty electrical and that it was on our end, therefore, they were not at all to blame for this.  Also, he said this was a completely different issue than the thermostat, which he claimed was a good call and that he did fix that problem correctly.  So, we hired an electrician (one who is extremely reputable) to come out and assess the situation because if it was our end, we knew we needed to not only get it fixed immediately for safety reasons, but I may have owed the guy an apology for insinuating this could have been their fault to begin with.  The electrician came and his findings were that #1, the units were too close to one another to begin with and that after checking the voltages, etc. with his do-hicky (LOL), his findings showed there was not one problem with our electricity, no surges or imbalanced distributions of power, no breaker problems, etc. on our end and he even called his friend who owns another air-conditioning company and his friend told him that had it been on our end it would have not only showed up in his readings, but it would have had to be a surge large enough to, at the very least, surge other electronic items in our home and that really...  it would more realistically be an outage-type surge where other neighbors would also have been affected.  Not only that, but both agreed that there's no way that it should be a 5-hour job to replace a compressor and that the money they were telling us they were going to charge was outlandish.  This electrician made a point of including some of this on the invoice and gave us the contact information of his friend in case we needed additional assistance with this matter.  Thank God for him and for Yelp and all the Yelpers out there who recommended him. :)  \n\nI'm doing this review in the hope of saving anyone out there who may be considering hiring these people for ANY reason a lot of time, headache and money.","date":"2016-08-03 23:37:42"}

I gotta say the flavours of Georgian cuisine is quite unique. These dishes seemed to be made to order because it took quite some time to receive. It may have been more than half an hour.\nMy favorite would be the hachapuri. It makes me think of having pizza but the cheese is distinctly salty and they roll up the boat edges with cheese so the crust is a delight to eat. I wish there were 2 eggs. It definitely balanced the saltiness of the cheese (feta?). It seemed like there were 2 layers of cheese: the crusty top and a layer of soft chese below.\nThe khinkali reminds me of Chinese dumplings but the flavours are truly very different from what I'm used to. It was creamy and dark. Each serving contained 3 dumplings  which doesn't seem like a lot but it really is like its own meal. It definitely needed something to cut the heaviness.\nWhile waiting for the food, we got complimentary appetizers: bread, pickled cabbage and an array of sauces (tomato, Georgian, spicy). The sauces and the pickled cabbage all have tastes I am not familiar with. I ate it all because the food was taking so long to come. The pickled cabbage I did not like so much.\nAll in all, the service was good, the food was filling and I was satisfied.","date":"2016-01-17 05:47:00"}

We went on a bike ride on the first beautiful day of the year and ended up visiting a friend in Verdun. We already know the other Comptoir 21 locations at the Latine Quarter and the Mile-End - but I like this one best. We sat outside (for the first time this year!) and really relished the last light of the day. The waitress was nice and friendly, although she was a little swamped. Once she took our order, the food came pretty fast. While we all had beer, I was actually the only one having fish and chips. My girlfriend had the veggie poutine (they have vegetarian gravy that is not bad) and our friend had a cheeseburger with fries and salad. We all enjoyed our food and I was pleasantly surprised by how calm this street is (compared to busy main streets like saint Denis or Mont-Royal where it's not as nice to sit out in the street). I was also glad for the opportunity to sit outside because sitting inside on the bar makes it harder to have a conversation when more than two people are involved, plus there is a lot of oil in the air near the kitchen.  We went to pay inside and discovered they only accept debit and cash :( but overall this is a good place to have a good time!","date":"2016-05-07 02:11:26"}

How can that be? The Lotus Garden has been around for 60 years and there's no question as to why. The food is fantastic and the staff is very friendly and accomodating.\n\nMy meal always starts out with an egg roll. These are no ordinary egg rolls...they're not tiny, and aren't considered one of those side items tossed in as an afterthought as at most Chinese restaurants. No - these egg rolls could be a meal! Filled with baby shrimp, cabbage, and carrots, the filling is tender with a bit of a crunch. The wrapper isn't your typical thin, fried, \"papery skin\". The wrapper is a bit more substantial because of the size of the egg roll..yet it's crisp on the outside and a little chewy on the inside. The best egg rolls I've ever eaten.\n\nI also like to order the fried pork dumplings. They're pretty basic as pork dumplings go, but they have a great flavor and the dipping sauce is very good. I'm pretty picky about my dumpling sauce. I don't like it too salty or too sweet. This is just perfect with a touch of heat.\n\nMy main course staple is the chicken with garlic sauce. This is noted on the menu as a spicy item. The Thai red pepper flakes give it the right amount of heat without overpowering the garlic brown sauce. It's a simple dish with slivers of white meat chicken, slivered water chestnuts, and a few mushrooms tossed in for good measure. This dish is so flavorful that you don't need anything else. I love the chicken paired with the crunch of the water chestnuts. They both take on the flavor of the sauce quite well. \n\nOther great dishes are the chicken lo mein, General Tso's Chicken, and chicken with broccoli.\n\nPlus the atmosphere is welcoming and cozy. No need for takeout!","date":"2009-05-19 17:41:51"}

The kiddo had the pepperoni flatbread which sounded like a horribly boring choice, but hey, what can I expect taking a moody tweenager who hates seafood to a crab shack!  The place was packed!  And for good reason!  It was our first trip there, but certainly won't be our last!","date":"2016-01-17 05:33:14"}

The remodel after Buttita's is as good as one can do when turning a lovely restaurant into a sports bar-style restaurant (though why one would want to do that is beyond me).  And that's where the good stuff stops.\nIn short, the service and all things related to it were glacially slow; the food, when it arrived, was mediocre at best -- and missing key elements (one whole order, and other parts).  This restaurant cannot possibly last if they don't figure out how to greet and serve customers, or get the food that was ordered actually to the tables.\nThe full story.\nUpon arrival, we found a vacant hostess stand, then a long walk down the hall to the dining room along which we saw no one who works there.  Luckily, we ran into friends who assured us that we could seat ourselves.\nAfter waiting at our table for some 15 minutes, we used a bit of self-help, and accosted a waitress to ask for some menus.  After another 5-7 minutes another waitress finally showed up with menus and silverware. She did not offer water, or to bring us a drink of any sort - just plopped the menus down and disappeared.\nQuite some time later, our waitress arrived, apologetically, and took our order.  We ordered an appetizer (cheese fries), and three meals: 1 burger (would have been on wheat bread but despite the menu, they had none), one 1\/2 ribeye (which the menu says was supposed to be thick, but which was certainly not), that should have come with some interesting sounding twice baked potato casserole, and one individual pizza.  My daughter ordered a diet, I ordered water, and my husband ordered a beer.\nThe water and diet only took about 7 minutes to arrive.\nThe appetizer might have arrived after another 10, but the food runner carrying the plate of cheese fries tried to deliver them to another table. Having learned he had the wrong table, the lad just took them back to the kitchen.\nEventually, the cheese fries arrived.  They weren't as hot as one would like, and for the price, there should have been a LOT more cheese.  The fries were no better than I could make using frozen crinkle fries from the grocery.\nWithin 3 minutes of the appetizer's tardy arrival, some of our food arrived.\nThe burger (but not the beer), and my steak with vegetable, but no potato casserole, and no pizza.\nThe waitress arrived, and asked if everything was there, we told her \"no\", and pointed out that we were missing the beer, the potatoes and the pizza.  Ten minutes later the beer arrived.\nMy husband then went up to the window where the pizza would have been put up for a food runner -- no pizza had been ordered.\nSo. \nThe steak was fatty, but moderately tasty, if only tepid.  The broccoli was cold, the burger was not as good as you can get at, say Hardee's (despite costing twice as much). \nWe never did get the pizza.  Or the potatoes.  \nI DID offer to come in as a consulting manager to help them teach the staff how to actually wait tables......","date":"2013-12-07 02:26:13"}

I concur with the commenter who noted that the parking situation is difficult.  However, being close to I-15 and Spring Mountain is a huge advantage for me, and it is open 24 hours.\n\nA relatively new member of the staff is Tony, who recently left Saigon 8.  The guy is terrific, and I've seen him iron out the bumps when language is a problem.  He's the reason I came to this restaurant in the first place.\n\nI've had pho twice and vermicelli with grilled pork, spicy (#68) once.  The pho broth was pretty good (not quite Saigon 8, but not bad), and the meat, etc., was also good.  The #68 was the best thing I've had there, and it is served in a bowl rather than a plate, which I think helped.  The restaurant was jam packed (Friday, about 1:30 p.m.), but service went smoothly.  By the time I was finished, I would say about two thirds of the crowd had left after eating.\n\nAt the table, There was hoisin sauce and Sriracha hot sauce, plus fish sauce and soy sauce.  There was also a jar of a pepper sauce that looked like a Szechuan sauce, but didn't have the heat.  There were plain wooden chop sticks, which I like, spoons, and small saucers, which I use to mix a dip.  I've mentioned in my Jenny Pho review that this is the way I prefer it, instead of bringing stuff out with the pho, and using lacquered chop sticks.\n\nOne thing you should know is that there is a sign that says cash only.  That changed a couple of months ago.  They allow major credit cards (Visa, MC), but they left the sign up.\n\nI like the restaurant for the quality of the food, which is pretty good, location, near I-15, and the fact that Tony now works here, and he's terrific.\n\nSomething I should have said earlier:  Pho Little Saigon makes its own Vietnamese sandwiches.  I brought some home, and they're very good.  Pho Saigon 8 doesn't  make its own, though there's a shop that makes them out the rear of their parking lot.","date":"2014-11-30 01:24:25"}

Than Joes Farm Grill is the place for you. Even if you have simple tastes Joes Farm Grill will have something to suit your needs.  It has beautiful decoration, great food and affordable prices, so why not pay a visit. \nJoes Farm Grill has a long historical background, with a house originally built in 1966 by the Johnston family. In later years it was decided to turn the farm into a restaurant with its food being home grown or locally brought in. The house development around the farm is Agritopia, and was dedicated to permanent urban farming. In fact if you live in the development surrounding the restaurant you can rent a garden lot to grow vegetables.  All of their products are certified USDA organic, and their focus is common food done uncommonly. They feel fresh food taste better and are better for you so why not share all that with the customers. They take the foods taste to a new level with all of the recipes and ingredients. \nJoes Farm Grill is delicious, unique and a fun experience. I feel most restaurants are chains and don't have the history behind them like Joes does, and because of this it makes the experience much more special. Knowing your food is organic makes it taste ten times better, and knowing you don't have to spend a fortune for organic makes me want to go again. It's really stands out among most and everyone in the chandler area needs to stop by and visit. \n First walking up to the twelve acre masterpiece is like going through a farm, with orange trees covering the path and large oaks surrounding it which gives a beautiful green glow of a garden.  It smells fresh and gives you an earthy vive. They are enormous and full of green vegetables that look extremely appetizing. They are covering most of the land and you can walk through them and see your food growing.  The building is white with large windows showing the back and the front equally, and the inside has simple decorations with light blue and green accents not to overpower the beauty of the vegetation growing outside. It holds no more than a hundred people and is rather spacious seating. The entire restaurant is very simple with a 60s feel mixed with a futuristic time. I ordered the jumbo breaded shrimp with fries, French toast banana peanut butter sandwich and the barbeque chicken pizza. I went with my sister because the portions are rather large and I could not have eaten it by myself. This was my first time visiting the restaurant and my sisters second. Everything so far was very pleasant and the employees were very nice. No more than ten minutes later our food was ready and it looked and smelt great. We sat down and I tried each dish, starting with the shrimp which were very large. The shrimp was crunchy and juicy and was simple and not overpowering. I thought it tasted very good and wasn't too rich which is a problem I normally find when ordering shrimp. Then I tried the French toast peanut butter sandwiches that surprisingly had strawberry's in it too. This was one of the best tasting things I have ever had! It was a house specialty and lives up to its name. It tasted like a gourmet peanut butter sandwich and was so flavorful and sweet. I had to order another one. Then I tried the barbeque pizza, I liked it but it wasn't my favorite. It was thin crust and slightly burnt, but it did taste good with the cheese and chicken combination. It just tasted like there was too many ingredients on the pizza that overpowered it. The prices weren't that bad either, the shrimp was the most expensive at 14.99 when I go again I probably won't order this again, just because it wasn't a to die for dish.  The peanut butter sandwiches were 10.99 and I crave these every day it was amazing! Than last the pizza was 12.99, my sister liked it more than I did so it depends on your taste but I probably will try something else. \nThe most important part though is the food, and not to leave you hanging was no matter what spectacular. Fresh fries galore. The most appealing part to me was the decorations and the gardens surrounding the place. I think the set up as if you're in a food court is a really interesting concept; you have to throw away your own food on trays, and clean up after yourself. I didn't expect that and I think it's a smart move on the restaurants part.  The calm and relaxing atmosphere, and no rush pace is really nice. \nI enjoyed Joes Farm Grill and I plan on visiting again. I think the organic concept and urban farming is a really nice thing to hear about in today's society. I feel better knowing I'm eating organic, and knowing there are still places that are going strong with the idea of organic. I hope the success of this restaurant shows others they can do the same. This restaurant meets all my needs as a customer, clean, green and tasty what more could you want.","date":"2012-06-25 23:41:20"}

Cue Club is large inside and out. Like how can they use this much space? The bartender gave us the lowdown as soon as we walked in: the building is divided into smoking and non smoking and each have either quarter tables or pay by the hour tables. Apparently you can only do pay by the hour if you're a pro. We chose the non smoking side and there were 2-3 other tables being used at the time. The jukebox was surprisingly really good until someone chose to play their own tunes. We did end up smelling like cigarette smoke afterwards. Not sure if this is from hanging out in the smoking area initially or if it's so overpowering that it gets into the non smoking area. They also have shuffleboard and a few carnival style games like skee ball. Knowing that most any billiards hall in Vegas is going to be equally smoky I think I'd rather come here and know your chances of getting a table are pretty good and they're at least attempting to offer a non smoking option.","date":"2018-10-04 17:47:38"}

However, it paled in comparison to many of the 2-starred venues.  The prices are obscene first of all - about double what I've grown accustomed to paying for a  similar experience (even the champagne).  Not to mention, the bites and bubbles menu at Guy Savoy we had tackled two nights prior was MUCH more affordable and more enjoyable.\n\nOur standard 5 course menu began with what was really  an oversized amuse bouche, a chopped apple with spices served in a glass wrapped with pictures of apples.  Good but not worthy of being called an appetizer.  The next dish was cold, shaved foie gras and thin slices of black truffles arranged in a salad.  The truffle slices were old or improperly stored and had absolutely no flavor.  I absolutely love truffles and should have sent it back; huge disappointment.  The foie gras was excellent however.  \n\nThe main courses were a boring fish cooked in a unneccesarily huge iron pot and some wagyu steak.  The quality of the steak was amazing, much like the one time I've had authentic prime wagyu before where I was charged far less for the pleasure. \n\n The one saving grace of the meal was dessert..  The presentation of a shiny, glittery ball that melted upon contact with a warm sauce was spectacular.  The dessert trolley offered a wide selection of expertly prepared mignardises.  The free take-home box of chocolates was a nice touch.    Service was great but not exceptional and the tables were packed too closely.  \n\nOverall, Robuchon is hardly deserving of 3 michelin stars based on our one experience, though your mileage may vary .  I feel that it was all style over substance and that may be fine for fashion bu not for food.  At half the price, I'd have been more forgiving (3-4 stars), but I felt cheated and given the many other excellent restaurants in Vegas, I don't feel there's any reason to visit Robuchon.  And I say this having gone in with a very positive attitutide after dining at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon in Paris, which was exceptional all around.  If you do go to Robuchon, my one piece of advice is to go a la cart, which I didn't realize was an option and seemed almost reasonable.","date":"2009-10-13 15:01:50"}

However, in their second race they put the pedal to the metal and tested the limits of their speed-limited carts.\n\nThe adults took the big carts for a run and I was lucky to be racing with novices and took the checkered flag in one of the two races. I was foiled by a \"pile up\" in one of the races which killed my lap average. :) My lovely wife took a nice stroll around the course and it was fun to wave as I zipped by.\n\nThe service was excellent. The track-workers were hilarious. All in all a great experience. \n\n** note ** Our first attempt to race was marred by the company Groupon and their multi-hour outage in March 2015. We did not print the groupon, we couldn't pull it up on our phones, and they had no way to help us over the phone (30+ min wait to tell us that). Clearly this had nothing to do with K1, and they were trying to help us, and other than just giving us the races for free I'm not sure they could have done more.","date":"2015-04-28 19:04:54"}

I have received sports massages, Swedish and deep tissue. I consider La Vida to be a very good facility and Angel to be a very competent therapist. For more than 6 months I have gone once every 3-4 weeks.\n\nI work out regularly and consider a massage a great way to heal sore muscles and low back pain from sitting at a desk all day. After my old therapist moved to Florida, I began the annoying process of trying new ones. Some have trouble dialing up or down the pressure. Some can't get the low back pain out like others. Some reek of cigarette smoke. Some are lazy, using one hand at a time instead of two.\n\nThen I found Angel, who is quite competent. If you wanna chat, she'll chat. If you want quiet relaxation, she'll put you at ease. If you say \"I hurt here\", she will solve it. I consider one of Angel's attributes to be the fact she can dial up or down pressure just BARELY, and maintain that. She can find where it hurts and, due to her through knowledge of fascia and layers of tissue, massage the pain away. After repeat sessions, she understands I need more pressure on the right side of my spine than my left. Angel's ability to meet her clients needs combined with her through knowledge of muscle and fascia along with the ability to maintain consistent pressure make her an extremely competent therapist.\n\nIf Angel is busy or sick, Ivan is a fantastic alternative. He's an A in my book, with Angel an A+. Edit: Forgot to mention, Ivan's strengths are deep tissue and neck work. If your neck specifically is killing you or you need real deep tissue, Ivan is your man.\n\nLa Vida is an upper middle \/ yuppie chain massage location with ample parking. I feel strongly that these are superior to middle brow chain massage places (such as Massage Envy) and superior to upscale spas (such as Sewickly or Seven Springs or Esspa). Simply put, La Vida has lots of returning clients and as such, a steady stream of business and competent and calm massage therapists with little turnover.","date":"2014-02-05 20:28:23"}

The hotel also offers a 4 p.m. late checkout for no additional charge, which was perfect since we were out until 4 a.m. the night before.\n\nMy complaints are extremely minor: no call-down service for the valet (but the wait was usually only about 10 minutes), no free WiFi ($12\/day is a little steep and I felt it should have been included), no additional toiletries like mouthwash or toothpaste and the shampoo\/conditioner wasn't very high quality. Boyfriend also thought there should be some sort of rubber mat for the shower, since it was all marble and was very slippery once wet. My only other comment is that the lobby is a little bit gauche (but, it's Vegas...what lobby isn't?!).\n\nAll in all, I thought this was a FANTASTIC value and, as I said, the best bed I've experienced in my life. I will definitely be back.\n\np.s. in response to those who say it's \"off the Strip,\" it's not. It's on the older part of the Strip (near Circus Circus), but it's not technically \"off-Strip.\"  Also, when it's 110 degrees outside, I don't know who is actually WALKING from casino to casino, anyway!!! Seriously? Doesn't everyone take a cab everywhere?","date":"2009-08-04 01:11:02"}

For the most part the wait staff was okay but could definitely improve but what I found awful were the lifeguards.   The first day we were at the pool three lifeguards just talked amongst themselves and bottle flipped to keep themselves busy. Yes, bottle flipped - my 8 year kids favorite game.  There was even a point where a young child in the pool went face down in the water and the adult with them didn't notice and guess what? Neither did the lifeguards.   No kidding someone is going to die on their watch if they continue like this.  The second day here it was two lifeguards having a bromance looking at each other the whole time instead of at the pool.  I get that it's not that busy but it's a job that has some dangerous consequences if you aren't doing your job even for a moment.  Instead they were passing a life float between them for fun, talking about picking girls up at the bar to the point my husband had to leave becauae he didn't want to here their childish talk anymore.   \n\nOtherwise a fantastic stay.

They have their entire line-up of current beers to choose from and an excellent little store that you can purchase bombers and interesting things like Trois Pistoles Mustard, Blance De Chambly Orange Marmalade, and Trois Pistoles Blackberry Jam (we purchased all three of these and they are all delicious)!\n\nWe hit the restaurant at a weird time (around 4pm) on this trip and they had a limited menu.  We did a meat and cheese plate to go along with a Sampler (3 ounces of Blanche De Chambly, Ephemere [Seasonal], Blonde De Chambly, Noire De Chambly, La Fin Du Monde, and Trois Pistoles) and Seigneuriale for me and an Ephemere Cerise (Cherry) for my wife.  A minor setback was that four of the six beers in my sampler came out of the bottle instead of the tap, so only two of them had that super-fresh taste, but it was still good nonetheless.  I would recommend finding out what is on draft and sticking with those, though, because those beers will rank among the best beers you will ever have in your life.\n\nRestaurant atmosphere was beautiful.  When we went during the summer, it felt like a lovely cottage house on the lake.  When it was cold in October, it felt like a rustic ski lodge just getting ready for the snow.  Service was very courteous.  We practiced our French this time (as there were some language barriers on the first visit) but both of our servers spoke excellent English.\n\nDefinitely recommended to swing through on your way up to Montreal.  Even if you're heading to Quebec City, it's not difficult to get to, just a long trip after you leave.  If you're heading back to the US, just remember that you'll be dealing with the border about a half-hour after leaving and that might not work out too well.  Please note that we were able to purchase Unibroue shirts on our first trip through but we heard a rumor that no more clothes were being produced.  I hope they change their mind on that one!

I love everyone I interacted with thus far at Gateway! I have two dogs - one loves everyone (so this was easy for him) and the other is ... a little more hesitant. When I came in, the lobby seemed pretty busy (they were getting low on seating, but not out) and I took a number. I was seen less than 30 minutes later, and never felt like my wait was too long.\n\nWhen I was taken back, there are tables set up, where the vets and vet techs come talk with you and help your pet. You're not in a separate room (like my old vet). This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think for one of my dogs it was better because while he got blood drawn and a vaccine, he was too distracted to care - there was (what looked like a) lab\/pit mix across the room who may have at one point looked at him! How interesting! and that golden over there! What's that smell behind me?\n\nEveryone that works there is friendly, and they work quickly. Since they work rather quickly, don't expect to sit down and have a long conversation. They get to the point, and then send you on your way because there are twenty more dogs to be seen. I never felt rushed though.\n\nIf you own pets, you know that they can be expensive. Even small expenses add up quickly. I ended up at Gateway because I priced out my annual vet trip at my old vet and cringed. A lot. I called around and checked out a few other places. I felt like Goldilocks. One vet was a little cheaper, but the staff seemed to hate their jobs and maybe me. Another vet was more expensive but seemed nice. Gateway? Gateway was just right. Gateway didn't offer me any discount, yet I felt like I got two for the price of one (I paid what I would have for just one dog at my old place). My dogs got their vaccines for the next year plus(heartworm and rabies), as well as kennel cough, and one of my dogs got microchipped. Previously I was told that the kennel cough vaccine is given every other year as a shot, and every other nasal - but Gateway had oral. That was so much easier on both of my dogs! One of my dogs is a pug, so the nasal was unpleasant for him and I (on the plus side, last year I got the vaccine as well - since he sprayed it all over me). \n\nBoth of my dogs seemed well cared for while I was there, and got plenty of love. The microchipped dog seemed neutral (and wouldn't take any treats from the vet tech after she took him to get microchipped), but he pug LOVED it. I practically had to drag him out of there. Being so incredibly busy, you'd expect Gateway to be a circus, but it was run pretty smoothly.

My ex-wife was Erin S. Just clarifying so they know exactly who posted this. I have spent over 1000 dollars and still not finished from 6+k in damages from the estimate on my car that I left there on a Wednesday afternoon and Geico estimated 15 days to repair it and then was told it was done the next Tues.morning. Corners cut? Anyone with half of a brain would agree. I asked where's my new rim damaged in the accident? Oh sorry here is another Geico adjuster present standing next to my car. Owner says my adjuster Tom Fletcher is an asshole and that the guy present standing next to my car was fair and he said he would get me a rim. And the owner also promised the rim regardless and when I asked how much more to do some touch up paint work he said FREE! Long as I would bring my business to them, from now on. \n     He surely noticed that my inspection was up soon as he promised me BOTH! Then I NEVER heard another word from them again since Dec.2016. And still have not been able to afford to fix all of the damage done in the accident that they overlooked due to quick in and out. I had to buy a new battery 3 days later when my car wouldn't start. Whatever mechanic worked on my car forgot to plug in the power cord to my new radiator cooling fan and my car overheated and had to spend money to get a diagnosis why it was overheating and was a simple wire not plugged in. So also proof it was never even tested to see if the new fan worked . This was a front end collision and then I had and still have a loud clicking sound coming from my front wheel where the rim wasn't replaced.  When I took it elsewhere for inspection soon after due to no reply from multiple messages left for the owner gone without a reply? Rather than bother with them after speaking with an ex-employee, I realized I was screwed.  So then I had a broken tie rod not noticed or added to my estimate and anyone knows you need an alignment when you replace a tie rod so another 300 bucks total. \n    But still have the clicking noise or loud tapping and my friend said it's either The CV joint or a bent control arm. But couldn't tell without it on a lift . So now will end up spending a fortune to finally get my car back to perfect operating condition like it was before one of their tow truck drivers just happened to be standing there in downtown Pittsburgh during rush hour with a walkie.  Waiting to prey on me. But I still haven't gotten to the most corrupt part.  Geico paid them from my estimate to recharge my A.C. since it was obvious that it was routine when my radiator, cooling fan, and coolant tank were all destroyed. But guess what happened when I went to actually USE my A.C. a couple months later once winter broke? Hot air. So I took it to Ryan's Auto\/Goodyear in Moon. Twp., and explained everything to them. They said well I can't imagine they would have not recharged your system with refrigerant.  So I paid for a diagnosis and dye ran thru the system and nice of them to only charge me 75 bucks and guess what? Cold air!!! NO LEAKS! SO THEY NEVER EVEN RECHARGED MY A.C. Crooks! And guess what else ? I AM AN UBER DRIVER FOR 2PLUS YEARS NOW AND UBER HAS THEIR TEST TRACK BLOCKS AWAY FROM THIS SHOP IN HAZELWOOD JUST BEHIND THE RAILROAD TRACKS! I have driven Uber employees there too many times to count and as well as them? I tell ALL of my riders to NEVER take their car here no matter what.","date":"2017-06-27 23:15:12"}

FIrst off the parking is very strange you have to park off to the side and walk past an empty boarded up building to get to the front door.  The decor is more rock diner than mexican restaurant, but nice enough.  On a weekday at 12:00 they were completely empty and it's a huge restaurant so that's a little bit of a concern right off the bat.  I had the cheese enchiladas which were ok, not anything special and kinda plain.  The Corn pudding for a side was something you never see and was the best thing on my plate.  The Anaheim Chili stuffed with sweet potato would be better if they removed the skin. It was pretty inedible the way it was served and very messy to scrape the pepper and potato off the skin to eat it.  I will give them props for trying something different, but poor execution at any rate.\n\nThe high point was our great server. She was very friendly and really nice.

This place is really nice and you feel a little bit underdressed if you aren't in your Sunday best. \n\nI made reservations ahead of time but the place didn't looked too packed for a Saturday night. We had a nice table an attentive waiter. We got our drinks pretty quickly and the martinis were strong.  There was some live music being heard from the lounge area near the bar area which had a nice touch to it. \n\nI still went with the meat selection even though this was the Ocean Club. My boyfriend and I both had petite which is served on a searing hot plate. The meat continues to cook on the plate and just easily cuts like butter. The steak just melts in your mouth as the seasoning of the meat and light butter from the plate meet in your mouth, I call it Meaty Symphonic Harmony. \n\nWe also ordered the sweet potato fries as a side. This is no mere small side dish but a mound of fries is delivered. Each fry is seasoned with an almost tempura like batter on the outside that leaves you craving more and more. I was stuffed after the filet and the fries and the yummy bread basket they bring you (with warm pretzel bread and other goodies). \n\nDessert is something that just can't be missed and I suggest the sinful delight of the signature Warm Butter Cake and whipped cream. The butter cake is rich and heavy with deliciousness and the whipped cream is no ordinary whipped cream. It almost has the consistency of ice cream as it hits your palate. \nThis is my treat for the year, it is expensive so be warned but it is also a high class meal.

My friend had the jambalaya, which looked deliciously comforting, but she reported the chicken was dry and overcooked and the shrimp was underseasoned.

Don't order it unless you're hungry or you really know how to scarf protein.  \n\nRoti canai - Must try for Malaysian cuisine it seems.  Crepe\/pancake style bread that you dip in curry.  The curry was good, don't remember what kind it was.  I don't think it was served hot enough, though.  It got cold too quickly.  My mom said the bread wasn't as good as their location West Covina.  \n\nChicken satay - Really light appetizer.   They give you really small, thin strips of chicken.  Don't expect this to be in any way filling (unless you decide to pour the peanut sauce all over your rice, and you just might be because that sauce is so sweet and delicious.  Almost sweet enough to be a dessert.)","date":"2010-01-08 03:17:23"}

Foodwise, it was good but I'd expect that from a place like this.  I ordered one of their Mixup lunches which gives you a salad option, a protein and a side.  I ordered the mixed green salad, the porcini mushroom and pepper encrusted strip and an order of carmelized cauliflower as a side.\n\nThe strip was amazing.  It came sliced over a layer of steak sauce.  It was cooked perfectly.  The salad was ok....mixed greens with tomatoes, blue cheese and a dressing that I still do not recognize.  The cauliflower came in a mound.  Honestly, this had to be 1\/2 to 2\/3 of the head of cauliflower.  It was seasoned with capers and other herbs.  While the taste was good, the quantity was entirely too much and I could only eat half.\n\nThe decor of the place is as you would expect with a lot of medium to dark wood but it just didn't do anything for me.  Same with the service. While they were all friendly, our water just didn't go beyond what he was expect to do.   \n\nSorry, Sullivans but I can get better service at Longhorn and frankly I think their food is better also.

My wife and I enjoy eating at this place but realize that it is small, and often busy. Another option is take-out which we often opt for, because we live close, and can still enjoy the food at home. That hasn't been an option the last two attempts that I have made to order take-out because the line was busy. The first time it happened, I had to go to the restaurant, order the food, and wait 45 minutes to get the food. \nI tried again on Friday to order food, and again the line was busy. After many call attempts, my wife and I decided to see if we could get a table. When I got there I was told that there was a 35 minute wait for a table. I went into the bar to see if there were any tables available. There was one available, however a woman who was waiting for a table in the main dining room was occupying it. We decided to eat elsewhere. \n\nIf there aren't ever any tables available, and I can't get through to order take-out, I can't see any reason to attempt to order from here again.","date":"2017-04-30 05:42:02"}

However, when the bartender at the awesome strip mall wine bar told me about this place you could get buggalo of food for less than a five spot, I was sold.  \n\nCook Out is an anomaly among fast food places in that its menu has everything you could ever want, or at least everything I could ever want (sans corn nuggets).  Cook Out offers the boring old hamburger thing but don't let that distract you- opt for the BBQ.  For less than $5, you get your own picnic.  \n\nMy plate had a hockey puck sized portion of pulled pork, a couple fingers of hush puppies, fries, and slaw. The chronic pulled pork was super moist considering it was 1 AM, and came topped with Texas Pete's.  Although it was delicious, isn't Carolina BBQ supposed to be heavy on the sauce?  The hush puppies were okay (more breading than bread), and the fries forgettable.  When it comes to cole slaw, I am a snob but Cook Out's slaw was surprisingly good; it was house made and very dry, but I mean that in a good way.   It's also worth mentioning that you can get a corn dog as a side.  I don't know why, but as a Southern gentleman, I agree with and salute that.  \n\nHow Cook Out really let me get my jollies was the drink menu.  Cheerwine- my god, if I ever make a lot of money I'm putting a fountain of that crack drank in my house.  If you're from out of town, drink up because that stuff can only be found in North Carolina.  They also have about 40 different kinds of milkshakes available, including seasonal ones.  The winter shake is eggnog but apparently they only have that one in December.  The fact that they have a watermelon shake in the summer blows my mind.  Be warned though, the shakes are thick like a Petey Pablo video girl- you'll need a spoon, or at least a boba tea straw.  \n\nAs I said, the idea of a fast food BBQ joint just doesn't do it for me, but Cook Out pulls together the concept beautifully.

The elevator was dark and dingy and barely fit two people with luggage. \n\nAs soon as we got to the room, the few hopes I had left were dashed. The room size was nice but it was just....dingy.

I had read somewhere that the original hem could (or should) be retained so as not to spoil the \"look\".  When I mentioned this to the proprietor, he told me they could absolutely do this, but assured me they could reproduce the original hem for substantially less money.  They were able to do the work immediately, and the results were great.  The length was perfect and the new hem indistinguishable from the original.  \n\nWhile I was waiting the five minutes for the job to be completed, another customer dropped in and had major alterations performed on a new suit - the results were impressive.  \n\nThe location is spacious and there is comfortable seating.  The price for my alteration was less than any other place I've frequented.   \n\nOn an earlier occasion, a friend and I took a well-worn leather jacket in for a repair estimate.  The tailor, who is obviously extremely talented, polite and personable, was honest about what could be accomplished and what the repairs would cost.  While we didn't use their services then (we threw the jacket out), I really appreciate a business that values honesty over a cash grab.  These guys are great.","date":"2016-05-07 02:16:01"}

While there are numerous \"famous-chef\" restaurants and buffets galore on the strip, sometimes you just need a break from mass produced hotel food.  \n\nPenang Malaysian Cuisine fit the bill perfectly.  Located on Spring Mountain Road on the second floor of a mini mall, Penang is a medium sized, modest looking restaurant on the outskirts of Las Vegas' Chinatown area.   \n\nThe first thing that struck me when we arrived was how empty the restaurant was...where were the people?  Only 1 table was filled, but from the way they were eating, it looked like they were enjoying the food.  \n\nThe menu is extensive and offers a large variety of appetizers, rice dishes, noodle dishes, curries, seafood, beef, pork, chicken, and vegetables.  I loved that in addition to the list of menu items, there are pictures for every dish!  This helped a lot since my husband and I are not all that familiar with Malaysian cuisine.   \n\nWe ordered the roti canai, a stir fry vegetable dish with shrimp paste (similar to chinese spinach, ong choy), a spicy curry chicken, and a rice noodle stir fry.  All of the dishes were delicious.   The roti was light, flaky, and hot.  The accompanying curry dipping sauce was the perfect vehicle for sopping up the yummy sauce.  So flavorful and spicy.  The vegetable stir fry and noodle dishes were also tasty.  The star of the show, however was the curry chicken.  OMG!  I wish I had a second stomach to eat more of that dish.  The curry was spicy and dripping with flavor.  Just thinking of it is making my tummy grumble and mouth water...\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive.  They kept filling our water and wanted to make sure we were happy with our food.  The prices were reasonable and portions just right.  \n\nOverall we were extremely happy with our meal and will definitely be returning!","date":"2011-03-20 04:20:27"}

Finally decided to try the Daddy shop - Bouchon (The Restaurant):\n\n10th Floor, Venezia Tower.. Walked in here for Brunch. The place had a Classy Decor, Very Professional Staff and Clientele were mostly Upper Class looking individuals. \n\nStarters:\n\nBread with butter, jam and ketchup?!: Bread was shaped like a branch with leaves.. something like that. It was hard but the inside was soft and tasted fresh. The butter was kinda hard too, the jam was pretty good and the ketchup I guess was for the fries to come? Who eats bread with ketchup?\n\nCheese Danish - Looked like a croissant shaped like a muffin, with a dab of some cream cheese butter on top. This was So Flaky\/Soft and the cream cheese butter lightly spread throughout was perfectly balanced.. This wasn't your ordinary cheese danish (pre-packaged grocery store bought), this thing was Superb!\n\nCroque Madame: Toasted ham & cheese on brioche with a fried egg & mornay sauce. Served with pommes frites.. Sounded quite fancy for a breakfast dish - In Layman's Terms = Ham & Cheese Sandwich with Egg and Fries! Toast tasted like a really buttered croissant with an airy texture. Ham & Cheese wasn't the oscar mayer ham nor Kraft cheese I use for h&c sandwiches back at home, it was much more gourmealicous! Plus, with the fried egg, more like a sunny side up egg and their white creamy\/frothy sauce, makes an Incredible Sandwich! Fries were served as a generous amount and were plain good. \n\nCorned Beef Hash with eggs and toast: Corned Beef hash came in shallow bowl with a blanket of overeasy eggs practically covering the hash. I scooted over the eggs to try just the flavor of the corned beef. They were little cubed chunks sitting on top of some pretty tasty juice\/sauce. The cubes tasted and had the texture of ham. The juice\/sauce gave it a great beef flavor but not the usual Real and typical corned beef I'm used to having. Nevertheless, it was Good. The toast were thick and had a buttery flavor and reminded me of a Crouton. Like a Toast Bread Shaped Crouton?!..\n\nFancy  Place, Great Service, Delectable Food But Came with a price.. $83.00 for 2 including 11.00 Tip.. Oh, it did include 2 Mimosa's!

This review is for Saryo.\n\nI'm a matcha fiend and have to politely disagree with all the other reviewers praising Saryo's matcha. It really doesn't compare with Tsujiri. Tsujiri has a much longer history of doing matcha and Saryo's matcha is simply not the same grade. High quality matcha is supposed to have a subtle sweetness in addition to a slight bitter taste. Too bitter does not mean it's better. Saryo's matcha soft serve is simply not as pronounced and lacks that subtle sweetness I would expect. The texture is also a bit more runny than I would like. \n\nAlso, their selection is much smaller than Tsujiri and most of the pastry items are a notch worse than Tsujiri. \n\nCustomer service wise, I can't get over one of their servers. It's a guy named Taiki I think. Horrible service. If you want good matcha drinks and desserts, definitely go to Tsujiri instead. Prices are about the same but you get less quality at Saryo. I might try their houjicha as that seems to get a lot of praise.","date":"2018-02-01 19:07:08"}

The building itself is historic, formally an industrial building, and its juxtaposition to all of the newly constructed skyscrapers make it stand out. It's an overall beautiful, and beautifully decorated, restaurant. My husband and I sat down for an after-dinner drink at the bar and were pleasantly surprised by the wide wine, beer and cocktail selection. We also ended up ordering the yucca fries, which were to die for. Our bartender Andrew was clearly well-versed in all of the selection and made great conversation!

Whoever the woman was that I was assigned to could not find a vein to get blood. This was important for medical reasons to get done and she was very unprofessional and rude. I recently moved to PA from Ohio, so I didn't know a phlebotomist here can only try three times. I kindly said to her 'can I ask why you can only try three times?' And she gave me a nasty uncaring look and replied quickly 'because I'm not a doctor'. After I left, all I could think was no shit you aren't a doctor, it's not a doctor's job to take blood, it's your job( a phlebotomists' job). I thought it was very unprofessional. I've never dealt with someone in the medical field that didn't truely care or have passion for helping me, especially if I ask a question. I don't remember her name, and if I did I wouldn't put her name out there. I just wish people would stop and remember the reason why they chose that field. Yes, money is great for most of the opportunities, but you really have to care and want to make a difference in order to be successful in the medical field.

So, a change in food was very much needed. My co-workers mentioned this restaurant a while ago. Today, I decided to feed my culinary curiosity and order lunch for my co-worker (aka my lunch homie) and I. Harry's Grill and Tavern, here we come! Here are some of the items that we ordered :\n\nMapleleaf Farms Duck Wings w\/Bourbon BBQ sauce and Jicama Slaw\n\n1) Initially, the chicken looked a little parched. Last night's chicken? Ummm, I hope not. However, the taste was decent. Portion size was good. \n\n2) The Jicama slaw was an excellent take on slaw. Traditional slaw (cabbage) can sometimes become very boring. However, the Jicama put a nice spin on it. The lunch homie, though, with her traditionalist, non-risk taking tongue, let the slaw fall gently from her mouth. You can't please every palate.  \n\nSmall Mixed Green Salad with Raspberry Vinaigrette and Mac - N - Cheese - Lunch Combo\n\n1) Harry's Mac - N - Cheese was the greatest joy that I experienced during this meal! The consistency and texture was great...not too dry and not loose...just creamy goodness in my belly! The levels of cheesiness was outstanding. And the light sprinkling of panko crumbs provided that last bit of contrast and crunch. The Comfort Food gods have bestowed their blessings on this particular dish.\n\n2) Bought the Small Mixed Green salad to eat for dinner. The portion size definitely small, but it's packed with some good stuff. Can't wait to get my greedy hands on it later this evening!\n \nHarry Old Fashioned Burger with a side of Sweet Potato Fries\n\n1) My lunch homie ordered a Harry's Old Fashion Burger with a side order of sweet potato fries. I snagged a few and they were good. I've ordered sweet potato fries at other establishments and I've always needed additional condiments (i.e. Honey Mustard sauce)  to add some taste. However, we both agreed that these fries were great by themselves. The slight sweetness of vanilla gave the side item a little more depth, while the salt reminds you that it's still a fry.\n\nShe was less enthusiastic about her burger, though. I believed she said that she had better times with a BK Whopper. Hey, I'm not a burger connoisseur,  so who am I to judge? The presentation of the burger was well put together. Wasn't sloppy or unappealing. Just your typical pub burger waiting to be consumed.\n\nAll items were moderately priced. My tab totaled to 31.12. Our lunch take out order was timely ( ready in 15 minutes) and accurate. Great location and if you're a non-parallel parker such as myself, they have easy access to the restaurant from the parking garage.  I will definitely return to see what Harry's has to offer for dinner and brunch. I must try the Lobster Mac - N - Cheese!!!","date":"2016-07-14 20:03:15"}

So we took a seat inside only to find 2 groups had left the patio 10 minutes later.  We would have waited for a patio seat if we had the option as it was a lovely night.  \n\nWhen we were greeted by our waiter he told us that we could only order off the summerlicious menu.

My food rating would have been 1 if not for the appetizer.  My boyfriend got the duck buns and said my appetizer was better.  The main course was the maple baby back ribs.  I was looking forward to these all day and was very disappointed.  They were way too spicy and not cooked very well.  Ribs should be falling off the bone if cooked properly - these definitely were not! There was also no plate for the bones or wet naps for us - but that has nothing to do with the food, but more to do with the service.  For dessert I had the brownie ice cream cake and my boyfriend had blue berry pie.  The pie had no taste and was infinitely better than my cake.  The brownie part was so hard that I couldn't cut into it with my spoon.  After two bites (my b\/f had to cut it for me!)

So instead I went and waxed the car myself with high quality Meguilar stuff I got from Walmart at around $30 and now it is nicer than new!","date":"2016-06-11 21:48:53"}

I want to be fair. We will start with the good stuff.\nWe stayed here back in June 2017. We, my husband and I, were going to Las Vegas for combination of Honeymoon and my husbands 40th Birthday. We invited some friends to join us. We ended up with about 20 of us there. We didnt all stay at the Flamingo. Only 6 of us did. Others stayed in time shares and other hotels. We are platinum members so we got to skip the long line, That was great. We chose the Flamingo because it was iconic. We knew it was a bit older and less expensive so we really were prepared for less fancy than other places. We were ok with that. Good thing too since our mini suite was quite run down and not very clean. Housekeeping obviously needs some training. But we didnt really mind. We had the Birthday party at Carlos and Charlies with all 20 of us. It was great and our waiter , Jason, was the best. We rented a cabana at the Go pool which was pretty nice but the mister in the cabana didnt work and just dripped water all over our stuff. Between my Husband and I and the rest of our party we spent many thousands of dollars. We had saved so we could do anything and everything we wanted and we did. It was great. At the point of getting our bags out of the room and heading down to check out I probably would have given them 4 stars. Quite pleased with the experience to this point....\nAnd that was the point where we discovered that the staff at The Flamingo did not want us to have happy memories. At the check out kiosk we discovered a charge of just over a thousand dollars that we didnt understand. We went to the front desk and were told that someone in housekeeping had gone into our room and noticed sleeping bags and enough luggage for about 6 extra people. -First of all, our do not disturb sign was up the entire time so no one was supposed to go in there at all.-  I told her that was a lie and we wouldnt pay it. She went in the back to talk to a manager and came out with out the manager and with no solution. She called housekeeping and was told the supervisor was not available but that they had pictures to prove it. I asked to see the pictures. They never could supply them. We had to leave to catch a plane but didnt pay. We had agreed with the front desk lady that it would be left as pending until the problem was resolved. After weeks of calling and getting no returned phone calls. Total run around. They never supplied us with pictures. It was a horrible experience. We found out we could contact Ceasars Customer Service so we did. They did call us back and said the charge had been removed. No sorry, No admitting they had made a mistake. It was more like just take it off to get us to shut up. So we dropped it because the charge was removed but never made happy. We will stay at Ceasars properties but never at the Flamingo again.\nI hope  it was worth it for you -Flamingo- to try to screw us out of $1000 because I can promise that no one in our 20 person party, many of which are Las Vegas regulars, or anyone any of us ever talk to about it will stay at your hotel. Ceasars is lucky that we love their other properties so much, especially Paris.","date":"2017-08-16 13:59:00"}

We get there and they put my husband and 70 year old dad right in the middle of traffic.  In a very claustrophobic booth.  We ask to move after ordering our drinks.  Took 20 minutes to get our drinks even after we told both waitresses and the hostess helped us move.  Pops and I both ordered the 16oz prime rib so we could have leftovers for lunch the next day.   They bring out our prime ribs and say our baked potatoes are on the way.  Pictures attached.  Almost half of it was fat.  I said oh my gosh that's a lot of fat.  Waitress says nothing.   \nPops and my hubby ordered salads and I ordered mushrooms as my other side.   They bring my daughters and husbands meals came.  A few minutes later we get out baked potatoes.   Hubby says where is my potato?   Well they had given him my mushrooms and he was well on his way of eating them.   So you would think I'd get new mushrooms right?  Nope.  Just slide the half eaten mushrooms to my plate.   Then we order another round of drinks and it takes 20 minutes to get a half chill fireball shot.    \nSo not a good experience.  If I'm paying $25 for a 16oz prime rib, I should get \"close\" to 16oz.  Not 8oz of meat and 8oz of fat.   \nAlso it's supposed to be unlimited bread.  How many loaves do you think we got?  Yup 1.  \nNot a happy experience.","date":"2017-01-27 22:16:46"}

The intercontinental suites are simply ok.  They're clean, they make your bed, bring you towels, etc.  But for the price, I have to give them only 2 stars.  \n\nOn the overpriced side, they're well over $100\/day for a std room, plus parking is $16 \/ day, plus wireless for $10 \/ day.  For that price in Cleveland, I expect at least something special.  That simply wasn't to be found at the Suites.\n\nI ordered room service.  Prices were on par with room service and delivery time was very fast, but my salad appeared as if it had been made a few hours ago and shrink wrapped.  They had a lame selection of beer on room service too.  They didn't even have single beers on their menu, they sold it by the six pack.  I managed to get a single bass which was palatable, but if you've read my other reviews, you know I like the local stuff better.  \n\nThe exercise room is pathetic, they converted a former guest room into an exercise room by removing the furniture and throwing in a bike, treadmill, and maybe an elliptical.  I don't remember for sure what was there. I took one look at it and walked out in disgust.  I went for a run instead, but you better know the area if you're going to do the same.  It's not too far from some places you definitely don't want to get lost in.  Head to the university and stay on campus.\n\nIf you're looking for a nice hotel in the area, I hear the other intercontinental is much better including an enormous workout facility.  If you find this place on the cheap and just need a place to crash, it's great for that.","date":"2008-10-04 17:40:27"}

Kit runs a nice and unique spot which is rarely seen these days - her vision is clear and focused in the decor, product assortment and services provided by the boutique.  \"Boutique\" truly is the appropriate word to use here, as the focus here isn't all about just turning product - she takes her time to educate and curate a broad array of interesting and cutesy little products that are not easily found elsewhere.  Outside of succulents, there is a finely collected assortment of little planters, pots and decorative items for creating your own miniature diorama.  My wife and I went to Plant It to participate in their succulent planting workshop.  The experience was wonderful.  Kit was hospitable, educational and created a very welcoming and fun environment for the experience.  We both enjoyed it very much - Kit helped document the process via taking photos, and guided us both in the selection, care and the assembly process.  Highly recommended--we will be back.\n\nNote: Plant It does not only have succulents, but also these cool \"sleeping flowers\" which are living, last 10 years, are low maintenance and come in some fantastic neon colors.  A great place for gift ideas, favors and sprucing up your place.","date":"2017-01-14 23:15:29"}

Well now we do! Haha, and unfortunately for my waistline it's uncomfortably close to my house, and just as good as it was in the states. Not much was lost in the cross-border translation. From the bright red and white self-congratulatory decor, to the awesome food and the giant bins of peanuts that fill the room and sate your appetite as you wait for your food: everything has come North. \nThe burgers are big (the standard burger is two patties) juicy and fresh. I like to keep the toppings simple (ketchup, mustard, mayo, lettuce, pickles), but there's pretty much anything you could want to put on them on the menu. The sesame seed bun does the job holding the messy burgers together and the processed cheese makes the burger creamy and adds just the right amount of flavour without taking away from the burger.\nThe fries are on par with the burger and as good as some chip truck fries:  big, fresh and crispy. And, as mentioned above, unless your incredibly hungry a regular fries can serve 2 easily and a large more. They actually measure out a heaping portion of fries and dump them in the bag loose to match the portion they give you in the container.\nIt's not cheap, you're looking at 25 dollars plus for two (share a fries and share a drink: there are free refills), but honestly it feels like you're easily getting your money's worth. No other burger chain comes close.","date":"2014-02-05 18:37:14"}

This place was a disappointment from beginning to end for us.\n\nFirst thing you need to know is that if you look at the menu, the only place the word prime shows up is in the title.  The steaks are not prime.  And they definitely do not taste like prime steaks.  They may have prime steaks on the menu, but unless it specifically says it is, it ain't.  \n\nSecondly, the service here sucks.  No sugar coating here.  I don't want people to make the same mistake I made and eat here when there is definitely much better in this town.  Go elsewhere for good service, or at least average service.\n\nWell, hopefully I've dissuaded you.  If not, or if you just like reading about poor dinners like watching a car accident, read on.  \n\nWe ordered the crabcakes.  And this is where the problems started.  We dutifully split it in half as usual, I began eating and noted it was good, then I bit into a crab shell.  Wow, that hasn't happened to me at any decent restaurant and I've had my share of crabcakes.  Disappointed but willing to overlook this, I bit into another piece of shell.  I'm paying a pretty decent sum for a crabcake that isn't remarkable in any way, and I'm biting into shells?  Unbelievable.\n\nNext up, the salads.  Except we didn't order salads.  They were for the table next to us.  With some horror I realized that our steaks and another table's salads were on the sam f-ing cart, but they served their salad first!  I don't think they do that kind of thing at a Black Angus, much less a restaurant that claims to be a top steakhouse.  Horrified but willing to ignore the two insults already suffered, we got our steaks and sides after a bit of a pause.  \n\nMy steak was ok.  18 oz bone-in ribeye.  The sauces weren't special but I'm not much of a sauce guy.  However, if you are going to pride yourself on your sauces, it should generate some interest from me.  Sides were decent.  Truffled mash potatoes were creamy, creamed spinach was what I expected.  I didn't much enjoy the bread though.  I got a pretzel roll that was extremely salty.  \n\nAnd then the final insult.  We finished our steaks, and waited a long time for our waiter to come back, but we didn't see him again.  The second cleaned up and brought us out the dessert menu, but that took quite some time.  At this point I hadn't seen our waiter in so long I assumed he actually left.  I thought that was incredibly rude to do that without turning the table over to someone.  Why are we ordering dessert still?  I wanted to give this place a chance to right the wrongs.  After ordering the crepe suzette (17 layers!), we waited a long time for our dessert.  A real long time.  And after finishing what I thought was a good dessert, we waited a long time for our check.  At this point our waiter returned!  We hadn't seen him since we ordered.  Apparently he had been taking care of another table.  He didn't tell us this, which would have alleviated a lot of the insult I felt by this time.  He cleared our dessert and we wanted no more of this restaurant.  It took a full 15 minutes for him to bring us our checks.  By this point we were angry.  We got here at about 6:45, and it was now 9:15.  So we spent an equal amount of time being seated, ordering and eating as we did waiting on our dessert and paying our check.  I won't be back here when there is so much better in town.","date":"2010-11-22 05:30:32"}

Just order it and move down the line and if there's a table then sit at a table or maybe take it back to you office.  It's just food.  This location is pretty average in terms of speed and politeness, and the food seems to be cooked appropriately so what else do you want?\n\nHere's my PRO TIP: When you go to the place where the drinks are right after you order, get a fortune cookie, but slip it into your pocket, then at the end of the meal, go back and say outloud \"Oh man I am going to get a fortune cookie\" so they don't think you're taking two and then swipe a second one and eat it there.  They've got the most delicious fortune cookies and even though the messages are usually something stupid about sports like \"Oh you're gonna have a good sportsball game tomorrow\" you can still enjoy the cookie, and you've already swiped a second one to enjoy later so you're the real winner - sportsball or not.","date":"2014-02-23 22:01:54"}

The bar was mostly full, waited behind a woman who was buying 5 margarita's and she stood there sipping on one for some reason while her friends sat a table. Luckily 3 seats became available at the other end and the 2 of us sat. And waited and then waited some more. The bartender on our side never once acknowledged us. Not even a glance for almost 10 minutes. She was getting a bottle of wine for man to take out somewhere. Going into detail about how she could not give him the Mesa glasses. I understand helping customers but sometimes a small glance to let one know you exist is all it takes for good service.I don't mind waiting but I do want to know we will be served at some point. But after 10 minutes of sitting there when she only had the 2 of us, the wine customer who already had his wine and a single man who was already served well that is not acceptable so we left. I am certain she did not notice or care but her attitude made me question another visit.","date":"2010-01-08 06:19:04"}

My Nissan Juke was very good to me so I decided I want to stay with Nissan. My first experience was great with the first vehicle. \n\nI've been looking around at the new Nissan Murano. I recently visited Avondale Nissan just to test drive and discuss costs. The people there were very rude and turned me off on buying a new car any time soon. \n\nThe other day I received a personal text from Bryson asking if I was in the market to buy a new car, which I have been. I told him what I wanted over text and about my Juke and finances. He was able to write up a deal and call me with the info which made the process easy! Saved so much time that could have been wasted at the dealership if the numbers didn't come out right. And they got my interest rate at 3.24 when Avondale Nissan was trying to give me 7% which is higher than the rate of my first car when I had zero credit. My credit  is in the 700's so there is no way I should have been ripped off at 7% like Avondale Nissan tried. \n\nI was offered a trade in value of $9700 at the other dealership. At pinnacle they gave me $12000 which significantly more and paid off my previous loan; even giving me some extra towards the price of my new Murano. \n\nI was impressed by my experience. John in financing was fantastic and very good at explaining the process. Bryson was also very helpful in making the process as easy as possible. \n\nI'm picky and the Murano i wanted wasn't available in Arizona so they found it in Nevada and had it shipped. I was told about 4 days and put into a loaner Murano. My new Murano came in a day in a half and is exactly what I wanted. \n\nI appreciate the professionalism of the staff here.","date":"2016-07-14 18:57:56"}

Even make a donation to their charity every time I shop there. Tonight's treatment by Chris and the cashier was unaccepptable. I was trying out different brands of dog kibble. Bought a high quality brand  a couple weeks ago. My dogs wouldn't eat it. Exchanged that for two different brands a week ago (Purina beyond and Hills diet). My dogs wouldn't go near the food. The Hills brand smelled awful. So I went to return the food. I walked in. Saw only one receipt was in the bag. I went to my vehicle to find the other one. When I came back, Chris is standing a few feet away from the register holding my receipt watching for me. I asked if there was a problem. His reply \"well yeah.\" He begins questioning me why I am returning the merchandise and mentions I seem to be continuously returning items. His question felt like he was interrogating me. I immediately took offense to his attitude and demeanor towards me. I said, my dogs wouldn't eat either one and one brand smells horrible. And proceeded to say I only returned one bag of food previously. Never returned any items prior to that. The prior cashier who helped me last time let me know food items can be returned if the dogs won't eat the food. Chris continued his line of questioning asking me what am I feeding the dogs now. Am I exchanging for another bag. I answered his questions and I shouldn't have had to. It's none of his business what I feed them now. And I do not want another bag. I'm upset. Frustrated by his actions and I rightfully tell him so. Telling him how I feel he is making me feel. I grabbed my receipt from him which he was holding onto tightly showing I am not liking his service. handed it back to the cashier and Chris continues to tell me, he is allowing the return. Absolutely right he is. Their no hassle free return policy was a huge hassle. I'm clearly unhappy and Chris continues to be a condescending on purpose by asking if there anything more he could do for me.

Using the overused term \"hidden gem\" really doesn't do Alexander Michael's proper justice. This place is so tucked within Fourth Ward, you most likely wouldn't notice it even if you were to traipse the entire neighborhood. Which, in my opinion, really makes this place shine. There's no grandiose entry way or signage laid out in lights. Just an old house on the corner of 9th with low lighting and a cozy interior. \n\nHINT: If you've never been here, I'd recommend cutting all the way over to Graham St and then turning onto 9th. You can't turn down 9th from Tryon, as 9th is split into two sections and you won't be able to drive direct. Also, parking is sparse. Find a place around the neighborhood and walk a few blocks. There is plenty of residential 2hr parking on the streets. \n\nSat at the bar and loved every creek and crack of the old floors and pillars. It's kind of tight quarters, but it gives it a cool pub feel. The taps coming directly out of the old cabinet style system is just gorgeous. Tons of local brews and some other fine beer choices were available. Didn't indulge as it was a 1pm lunch. I ended up order the london broil sandwich. Goodness gracious I'm glad I did, too. It was just right for lunch and paired with the pasta salad, you can't go wrong. \n\nService is so friendly here.

Two days ago while we stayed at Caesars Palace, my friend insisted to have some to-go order of Chinese food within the hotel despite my objection. So, we went.\n\nWe ordered a BBQ Platter ($29.99), a Pork Ribs in Sweet Vinegar Sauce ($19.99), and one order of custard bun - Egg Yolk Quicksand as they called it ($6.99). In total, we paid over $60 for these three items. \n\nI was astonished to see the BBB Platter when we got back to the room and opened the box. This platter was about half the size of the same dish I ordered once there two years ago. In the combination platter, there were three kinds of meat - 4 very small pieces of Poached chicken, 4 very small pieces of Roast Duck and BBB Pork. I almost couldn't believe they were serving so few pieces of so tiny size at such quite high price. As to the BBB Pork, it was chopped (not slicked) into pieces about 5 times thicker than normal sliced BBQ Pork served at most other restaurants. Their poor and tacky knife cut made the BBQ Pork look as dull as a portion of pig's frozen dead body, totally unappetizing and iffy. I was wondering how they could charge $30 for a small box of food with quality level lower than that of a food court vendor. \n\nI must give a low rating to this restaurant again. I am a Chinese and I know how good Chinese food should look and should be prepared. They still don't think they should upgrade, instead they shrink the portion and size of the food and raise the prices with no business ethics at all. Doesn't Caesars Palace feel ashamed to allow such a low-end place sitting there to fool and rip off non-Chinese tourists and suckers?\n\nAfter this bad experience, I checked again their recent ratings on Yelp and found they've got more and more poor ratings. They deserve for what they are doing, and I believe if they continue doing so, they won't stay there too long.","date":"2017-08-16 04:15:55"}

So since i was stuffed from an incredible waffle from Sugar Cafe I decided to get my fav salad of the moment, a beet salad.  It was a pretty big disappointment.

Ok, I'm looking too much into this beet salad, but for realz, it was sorta lame.  \n\nOur server was OK, but sorta seemed like she wasn't into serving that day.  She kept forgetting to bring my friend her drink and she just seemed pretty lackadaisical.  No big thang I guess, I served and I was horrible!!  The outdoor patio was also really cute.  I was actually really into the whoel feel of the place, inside and out.  Very romantic in and very casual and comfy outside.  \n\nService was pretty slow too.

At the other Wingstop locations I would feel cramped and would want to leave soon after finishing my meal.\n\nThe wings I got on this trip were exceptionally large.  I've never had a problem with wing size at Wingstop and these were even bigger than usual.  I typically get the hot sauce which has a decent amount of kick.  The wings are never undercooked or overcooked and are quite tender and juicy.\n\nI love the ranch sauce.  It's thin without being watery.  Hard to explain, but it's perfect for going with the hot wings.\n\nThey have TWO of the coke machines with the touchscreens.  I love those touchscreens, but people can be slow figuring them out.  With two of them there I hardly saw a line waiting for them.\n\nThe only negative about Wingstop is the price.  A small soda, dozen wings, and a ranch cost me over $12.","date":"2013-10-03 13:42:56"}

I placed my order around 4:30pm directly on their website. Anyway, it is clearly marked that they deliver to the H9R area.  One can also find this restaurant listed on the Tasty Boom food delivery service as well.  I have double checked that I am indeed part of the delivery zone.  I received an order confirmation from Tasty Boom (as they are in charge of all the online orders).  After waiting for an hour and half I called the restaurant's direct line.  The person who picked up told me that a representative from Tasty Boom was supposed to call me because they had decided to cancel the order.  I never received any phone call, text, or e-mail stating that the order had been cancelled.  The Mr. Falafel employee also asked me, \"If I just placed a bunch of things in my order to make the minimum?\"  I then explained to him that I ordered what I wanted.  Also, I am not sure why \"what\" I decide to order is any of his concern as long as I meet the delivery requirements.  I expect that even if I was just ordering extra things I still would expect the food to be delivered.  I then called Tasty Boom and they told me that the restaurant had chosen to cancel the order because they felt like it wasn't \"worth it\" for them to deliver.  I would like to note that the website states a $20.00 minimum and my order was $25.00.  Also, the restaurant is located on Saint Jean's Boulevard and is a less than 10 minute drive from my location even with lots of traffic...what a joke and what a waste of time.","date":"2018-03-03 23:23:37"}

The wait was a little longer than I would have liked but well worth the wait. The hibachi chef put on a great show and made my mom feel extra special. The soup was tasty and the tempura shrimp appetizer was fantastic but expensive for only getting two pieces.  \n\nOur group ordered, lobster, filet mignon, shrimp and the kids steak hibachi. The filet mignon melted in your mouth, and the shrimp was delicious. The lobster was a little salty but still really good. Dishes were also served with fried rice and vegetables which were also really good. \n\nIf it's your birthday the staff gives you ice cream as well as sings you a fun birthday song! Highly recommend coming with a group of friends or family. Tables seat 10.\n\nOne downfall is they do not take reservations on the weekends.","date":"2016-05-07 03:19:17"}

We paid ~ $750 for three week nights in October.  \n\nLocation:  Fabulous because it was near the quaint old town area with plenty of areas to stroll through and pick up breakfast.  1 block away from the metro stop and about 3 blocks from China Town.  About 5 blocks from the water front and Archeology museum.  \n\nService:  Very friendly and tried to be professional but some odd answers to my questions.   They seemed to always try to sell their own restaurant whenever we wanted suggestions from the concierge...even when we asked to find St.Viateur for their famous bagels.  I also tried to get a room with a good view - one of the customer service reps said she would try, since the rooms were not ready when we arrived.  But then another service rep looked at her and mumbled something in French... She then said that our room does have a good view and then within the same sentence, said that really, there were not good views in this hotel.  Then, our toilet had very low water pressure so I called the front desk who said they would relocate us to another room. 15 minutes later, after frantically packing our things, a guy comes up to the room and says no other rooms are available and they would fix it in the a.m.   \"A\" for effort but \"C\" for the odd answers and possibly... lack of experience? \n\nRooms:  Loved the brick walls and hard wood floors INSIDE the rooms - a lot of personality with very high ceilings.  Big bathroom with full bath.  Good blow dryer in the room, iron and board, umbrella, robes, iphone\/ipod dock on radio.  Bed was a bit firm for me (I am soft biased) but otherwise comfy.  \n\nFitness room:  small but my husband said was good enough - had cardio machines and weights.  \n\nWe received a free drink voucher for their restaurant upon checkin.  Our friends also stayed in the hotel and opted to buy package deal that included 4 free metro passes and coupons... not sure how much more they spent but they also got a bigger room.","date":"2012-11-06 08:11:22"}

You could tell they were really trying to make an impression.  I returned there about 2 weeks ago for AYCE and the experience was quite different.  I went early, about 11:30 a.m. because I knew they are much busier.  There were only 4 other people in the restaurant.  I ordered my first round and as I waited, the restaurant filled up quickly.  I waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  When my first order of sushi arrived, it wasn't everything I ordered but I was glad it came because it took the edge off.  I slowly received more sushi.  The 3 orders of eel that I ordered never came.  I reminded the server.  She said she would check on it.  I waited some more.  I asked her for the 2nd time about the eel.  Even though the restaurant was practically full, she was the only server working, ping-ponging from table to table.  Since I had nothing to do I kept an eye on this poor guy at the bar who wasn't even acknowledged for at least 1\/2 an hour, not even to be given water.  He kept trying to get someone's attention!  Finally about 12:15, what I thought was another server arrived, turned out he was a bus boy and could only pick up plates and fill water.  FINALLY my eel arrived, it was super mushy, was much larger than the other sushi and didn't have that warm toasted crust.  You could tell it was thrown together.  Since I made such a big deal out of it, I ate it all even though I didn't like it.  I felt so sick after that, even though I didn't get my money's worth I didn't want any more (she wouldn't have been around to take another order anyway).  I was in the restaurant for well over an hour even though when I arrived I was one of 5 people there.  Then on the way out I noticed a dead roach on the floor, I nearly threw up.  The quality and service went way down with this place which is unfortunate.","date":"2015-07-16 06:55:28"}

It's not a sleazy, cheapo place. It's cozy and professional.\n\nLong version: My husband and I decided to make an impromptu trip to Las Vegas. We booked our hotel two days in advance and winged it while we were there. We knew, though, that we wanted to get a couples massage.\n\nOf course, we headed to Yelp, and read lots of good reviews for the hotel spas, but oh my gosh--$400 for a 50 minute massage? Ouch. No thanks. So, I Googled \"couples massage\" and came up with three non-day spa\/hotel places in Vegas. I called all three, checked reviews on all three, and then checked appointment availability and came up with Massage Pro. Booked an appointment sight unseen, and crossed my fingers.\n\nThe place is right off the strip--just head west on Sahara for a couple miles. It'd be too much to walk, I think, but it's close enough that taking a taxi shouldn't be too expensive. We had our car with us and it was a very quick drive.\n\nWhen my husband and I walked into the office, we were a little worried--the reception is super small and feels a little like a dentist's office. We filled out our paperwork, and were taken back to a much more spacious waiting room with dimmed lights, relaxing music, and a little fountain. From there, we were met by our massage therapists. We did have to wait a little longer than we expected, but it was only seven minutes beyond our appointment time, and they more than made up for it during the session. I think they spent an extra ten or fifteen minutes on us to make it up to us. :)\n\nWe ordered the 90-minute combination massage, which was a blend of Swedish and deep-tissue techniques. We paid just $90 each! Even with a $20 tip on top of each massage, we were still under the next least expensive massage we could find--and the experience was phenomenal!\n\nWe had a male therapist and a female therapist (we had confirmed this was all right when we called and made our appointments) who guided us to a designated Couples Room specially set aside for couples massages. The room was decorated, dimmed, and had soothing music playing. The beds were heated and we were asked if they were to our liking temperature-wise. They were perfect.\n\nDid I mention the therapists are nationally and locally licensed? Yeah. Cool.\n\nSo began ninety minutes of rubby, relaxing bliss. The therapists were receptive to our suggestions--a little softer on that spot, please; a little harder right there. The therapists were nothing but the utmost of professionals, watching our muscles for the relaxation of knots and responses to too much pressure. They adjusted their techniques to our preferences and my husband and I had a wonderfully relaxing afternoon. We had very enjoyable massages.\n\nWe didn't pack robes with us, and, not being a day spa, they don't provide them, so they were kind enough to let us use their shower usually reserved for customers getting body scrubs so we could rinse off some of the massage lotion. We got big, fluffy towels to dry off with and they even gave us an extra one, just in case.\n\nIn short:\nUNBEATABLE prices\nProfessional, personable, skilled, licensed, receptive therapists\nCouples massage room!\nNot a day spa--ambiance is definitely service-oriented, but still decorated and cozy\nAwesome massage\nNot sketchy (they have zero tolerance for inappropriate behavior)\n\nWhat are you waiting for?! Book your vacation massage for less than the price of most show tickets!","date":"2011-04-22 01:38:45"}

No thanks!\" I was recently in Las Vegas the week of Independence Day for a poker tournament and my back was hurting so much that I was having difficulty sitting at the tables for long periods of time. I got massages for three days in a row but got only a small amount of temporary relief. I thought about going to a chiropractor, but remembered how many times my friend had tried to get me to see her acupuncturist and decided I should give it at least one try. Boy, am I glad I did! \n\nThe needles are very, very fine and I only felt a small prick with a few (not even close to either a vaccination or finger stick)-- this was NOT a painful procedure. He inserted 16 of them from my neck to my ankles and then asked me to guess how many were there. I guessed 6-8. I seriously didn't even feel the others and none of them hurt. They then hooked some kind of electrodes to 6 of them (I was lying face down and couldn't see what he was doing) and sent weak electrical pulses through them. If you've ever had TINS treatments, the amount of current was far less (no muscle twitches) and felt as if someone was gently tapping my back in each spot. Then, they turned off the lights and played New Age type music while I relaxed. I don't know how long that lasted (maybe 15-20 minutes?) because I didn't have my watch on, but it was like taking a nap. After this time, they disconnected the electrodes and removed the needles. I felt very calm and a little groggy at this point. I had told him that I would be playing poker later that evening and he recommended that I take a nap when I returned to my hotel. I took his advice and when I awoke, I felt great! In fact, I was even able to walk from Caesar's to Bally's later to catch the free shuttle without any pain. Sure, that's not a great distance, but there is no way I could have done that prior to my acupuncture treatment. I got a second treatment the next day (my last full day in town) and when I left Las Vegas, I was pain free. Just today (about 10 days later) my lower back pain has been bothering me again (though not as severe), so tomorrow morning I will look up the local doctor whom my friend recommended. I hope he is as good as Dr. Lok! If you are in Las Vegas and have back pain, you really need to go to Dr. Lok.","date":"2012-07-16 04:33:37"}

These folks have less than no clue about what customer service is. My brother moved to Scottsdale from Minneapolis. He arrived well ahead of his PODS container. However, when the container did arrive no one bothered calling to let him know his unit had arrived. When he called them he was told, \"Oh yeah. The container arrived last week.\" It never occurred to anyone to let my bro know that his container had arrived.\nNext was the issue of trying to schedule delivery of the unit to his home. Problem is, no one at PODS location has any discernible grasp of how production scheduling works. All they were interested in telling him is that there will be extra fees for overtime because they're so busy. Since when are the internal logistics problems at PODS any concern of the client? Thankfully, my brother is a very persuasive bloke and he takes very little guff from incompetent lackeys. Of course he paid no additional fees, but a more timid individual would likely be held up for extra charges.\nAnd then there's the challenge of trying to contact PODS. All communication and billing are handled at a centralized call center, and it's a typical call center staffed by individuals who are paid far too little to give a crap about people calling in with questions, problems, and concerns. So, if you want to contact the local location to see if the unit has arrived...no dice! You get to deal with a call center lackey.\nMy brother did give a positive shout-out to the guys PODS sent out to empty out his home in Minneapolis and load the container. They damaged only two pieces of furniture and they didn't break near as many fragile items as he was expecting they would, so he was pretty pleased with that.\nBottom line here is that until PODS matures and figures out its logistics issues, timing issues, and customer service issues, you'll do much better with U-Haul or Atlas Van Lines.","date":"2015-11-18 19:10:00"}

The place is just so laid back, with the giant apple-shaped apple stand on the side of the building, which used to sell candy apples and apple cider, though I haven't seen it open in some time. Maybe I've just been arriving at the wrong time? There's also currently a petting zoo on the other side of the building, with a coin-operated machine that dispenses feed for the animals. \n\nInside is your typical tiny grocery store\/butcher. They do sell many specialty items that you may not find at a regular grocery store, along with pretty much anything Apple that you can think of. But all of that is foreplay to the main attraction: THE PIES. They have their own little pie patrol that bakes the freshest, most delicious homemade pies, I don't think I've ever bought one that wasn't 100% fresh and amazing. \nI've never really been a pie-guy, but this place is different. And if you don't want an entire pie, they also sell slices. Their strawberry rhubarb is amazing. I've never Jason Biggs'd a pie before, but the s.r. has definitely gotten a couple of suggestive glances from me.\n\nAs for the service, the employees are always very sweet, helpful, and have been known to give out free apple cider at times.\n\nI also can't complete this review without mentioning the Apple band. That's right, a Chuck-E-Cheese-esque Apple band is occasionally available to play on their mini-stage...you just have to catch them at the right time. Those apple rock stars can be pretty big divas.","date":"2011-05-27 07:01:13"}

It's dimly lit, with beautiful dark wood and a fully stocked bar waiting for you to imbibe. \n\nThey have six wines right now, but the grapes are crushed fresh in house (or at least in the presence of the winemaker, Tim), so you know they're not rushing to produce a mass amount of products, just a handful of marvelous blends! My fave of the moment is the Malbec. I've been really into it for a while now and really love their blend. I honestly have had some pretty bad ones, and this is true to form. I also think this is such a white wine type of area, I'm glad to see a place putting effort into promoting the reds.\n\nBut here's the other cool thing. They have a downstairs area that matches the same cool vibe of the upstairs. It's thee perfect place for an unique event. It apparently fits around 100 and would be the perfect pick for a small reception or a hip party. I wouldn't care what kind of event it was, I'd want to crash it here! \n\nThey also offer custom labeling, so if you ever need a unique gift this is the way to go!

Let me start by clarifying an inaccurate statement, Blue Martini does not take reservations on Sunday night. They actually are attempting to change a Bar Restaurant into a Night Club on Sunday nights. \nNeo-Soul, a promotion company operating on Sunday's has increased their visceral attitude toward anyone not willing to pay 300 dollars for a  bottle service on Sundays.  On Sunday August 7, 2016, I visited the Blue Martini as I always do several times a month.   During my visits I normally spend  around 100 dollars.  After checking online banking I discovered that I have spent approximately 500 dollars since mid May.\nYesterday I ordered chicken wings and a cocktail around 730pm.  I waited 45 minutes for my wings.  I look forward to eating BM wings on Sunday since it is the only day that I eat Chicken.   Half way through my chicken wings a Neo soul representative came over to where I was sitting with a retired engineer.and a VA Nurse.\nThe unknown Neo soul promoter described as early 30's, black male, bald head and bow tie, failed to introduce himself.  The first thing out of his mouth was \"Other women are wondering why you have a stool to eat your dinner with. He further stated, I have to ask you if either of you two are disabled\" (he clearly was the one to ask about disabilities).. I was embarrassed that he would stand by with a security officer while I ruffled through my purse in the dark for 3 minutes. I assumed he would be allowing me a reasonable accommodation after forcing me to reveal my disability and showing my credentials.  Instead he was throwing me out of my stool and escorting me way in the back where they hid chairs for Profit.  The promoters actions were consistent with some one without knowledge of Restaurant Regulations.  \" if a patron orders food from a bar that patron should be afforded a proper bar stool\".  Meaning,If a patron orders food from a Blue Martini Bartender at a bar and pays for the meal a bar stool,and proper eating utensils  MUST be provided. Blue Martini can't profit from a customer and then not provide a stool in order for Neo Soul to increase it profits.  The Neo Soul rep. appeared surprised when I produced my Armed forces Veterans disability ID as if he was not expecting that. I explained to him I was a Desert Storm Veteran and retired from the armed forces and Las Vegas Metro.  He then told me to grab my half eaten chicken wings in order to place me out of the way in the back.  I was not going to pay several hundred dollars for a bottle service and chicken wings to hear the same band so that I could sit down for ten minutes to eat.  I asked him if there was an emergency and why I could not eat my last two chicken wings.   I explained that it would not be unreasonable to allow a disabled veteran to finish two wings and then move.  He said \"Let's take the disabled veteran out of it\".  I asked why when he was the one that interjected the disability as a prerequisite to a bar stool which is inconsistent with restaurant  practices. It is also unsanitary to drag your food around in the dark .  The Neo Soul rep also felt it necessary to have a Blue Martini Security officer stand by as a \"Show of Force.\" We took this as excessive, embarrassing and humiliating because it was for profit.  Neo Soul felt  it necessary to interrupt my dinner  so that Neo could increase profits.  Neo Soul is confusing Blue Martini with nightclub practices. Neo Soul and Blue Martini's failure to fallow guidelines of restaurant\/Bar have generated a multitude of complaints.  Lastly, He continued to make the situation worse by making me stand and eat my remaining two wings.  \n\nNeo Soul claim that by removing seats people are able to get to the bar to order drinks easier are \nfalse. The first bar where more then 25-35 bar stools remain, individuals are allowed to eat and drink around the bar with a proper bar stool. \n\nSecondly, at 815 pm there appeared to be about 5 people at the bar on this particular night.  \nLastly,the stool that was taken from me was moved to a small high table where 3 dancers immediately occupied the table.  \n\nThe entire scene was mishandled and escalated by the Neo Soul rep.  The rep who hides dozens of chairs from restaurant goers was unnecessary and purely for profit.  I would like to reiterate the fact that,  You absolutely cannot make reservations. This entire \"rigged system\"  is sit up to increase the profits of the unprofessional Neo Soul reps desperate to make more money. \n\nI asked  to speak with a Manager at this point.  This manager can only be described as stocky, Latino with a neatly trimmed beard.  He was extremely professional and apologized for the behavior of the Neo Soul representative's behavior.  He further stated that Neo Soul Rep was unprofessional and to contact Scotty M immediately.\nAdditionally, he offered to purchase my chicken wings and I said \"thank you but If you could give us some drink tickets instead.","date":"2016-08-13 01:29:59"}

It used to be unlimited, along with all the thinly sliced beef, pork, and sliced chicken, seafood (including crab legs and shrimp), veggies that you can DIY cook in the hot pot at your table.  But for what you are getting and what they are charging, it is still a good value proposition. Come on, for $20 a person without the hassle of getting all the ingredients yourself and the cleaning up afterwards, totally worth it! \n\nI first came to Shabu Grill all the way to this section of LV because of an UYE hosted by Debbie N.  The event was a resounding success, and we pretty much got to try as much of their menu as we were able to stuff down our faces.\n\nSo when a guys night out event was recently organized at this very same location, it was a no brainer for me.  The food is still very good, the service was just as attentive, and the experience just as positive.  The restaurant even accommodated us with extra portable hot pot setups, so 2 instead of 4 or 5 people shared each hot pot.  It just worked out better for us.\n\nThe main reason I like this place is the fact that everything for the shabu shabu portion of the dining experience is DIY, including getting the ingredients from the refrigerated cooler nearby.  I love the fact that I can get as little or as much of something, instead of being forced to finished big plates of one item before I can order more or something else.  \n\nThe DIY sauce and condiments bar is pretty cool.  Not as extensive as comparable restaurants in SoCal, but you get to customize your dipping sauces as wonderfully or not so fantastically as your creativity and inner toque wearing chef would allow.  But it is pretty hard to score a TOTAL FAIL in this minor endeavor, so relax and just have a go at it.  The important thing is to have fun and enjoy this interactive meal solo, but preferably with a small group of friends.\n\nI would totally go back, especially when the weather is still very nippy in the evening.\n\nNote:  There is a \"bar\" in the front when you walk in, but they do NOT serve alcohol at this establishment.  But if you have room for some beer or other adult beverages, there is a PT in the same strip mall.\n\n\n\nReview #2 of 2014","date":"2014-01-17 04:05:45"}

I \"Yelped\" banh mi sandwiches for Phoenix last night because I was craving one and wanted to find out what Yelpers out there think are the best.  I was a bit surprised to see Reathrey on the list as they are not a Vietnamese restaurant, but having patronized the restaurant at least a half dozen times, I decided to read through the reviews.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I originally went to the restaurant after reading the glowing article in Phoenix Magazine.  Our first visit there was pretty uneventful.  We ordered the Mi Keaw soup, spring rolls and the crepe (which by the way was served slightly burned with that side facing down- but I never complain about my food and ordered it again on later visits).  My only real complaint that first evening was the incredibly uncomfortable bench seating.  On subsequent visits we opted for the tables in the center of the space.  I have tried a number of different things on the menu and while having no other Cambodian food to compare it to I find it to be just meahhh.  My boyfriend on the other hand loves the Mi Keaw soup and has ordered it as take out a number of times and is the reason for our repeat business.  In my opinion the Pho at many valley Vietnamese restaurants is much tastier.\n\nOkay - back to the reason for the one star review.  So here I was reading through the reviews when I started coming across the owner's incredibly RUDE, SARCASTIC, CONDESCENDING, DISRESPECTFUL and downright UNACCEPTABLE responses to his less than stellar reviews.  I have three words for you GET OVER YOURSELF!!! I don't care if you are running a Michelan star rated restaurant (which CLEARLY you are not) that type of disgusting behavior will run your business into the ground.

I needed one very badly, having been using a relative's vehicle for several months, but that they now needed back. I had planned ahead and done my research, and wanted a Ford CMax Hybrid. My work offered a discount\/cash-back deal through Cars.com, so I submitted the request and my info was sent to Berge. My plan was to take advantage of the 4th of July weekend specials.\n\nI was almost immediately sent an email from a salesman named Chris. He wanted to know what I was looking for in a vehicle. I replied right away with the details... But the only email address given was a generic one, nothing direct. There was no response. A few days later, he sent me another email, this time with a map to the dealership, but with no indication my reply was received. I replied back, asking for some quotes, but again got no response. I was anxious with the impending July 4th weekend, but held hope I could still make contact. I decided to call. \n\nUnfortunately, the only number he gave me was his personal cell. That Friday after work, I called and was immediately sent to voicemail. I got a text saying he was at dinner, but would return my call. I left a voicemail explaining that I badly needed a car, either from him or someone else at the dealership, and that he hasn't actually replied to my emails (maybe he forgot to check the general inbox?) and I asked him to call me  back ASAP. I really needed the July 4th specials. \n\nThe weekend came and went, no reply from Chris. Frustrated, I went to a different dealership in Scottsdale and worked with wonderful people, and that next weekend negotiated a deal on a beautiful CMax that made up for missing out on both the holiday weekend deals and the cash-back deal through my work. TWO WEEKS LATER Chris emails me to say their servers were out of commission, which is why he didn't get my emails, and he would love to help me into a car (this all being said in poor spelling and no caps or punctuation ).\n\nMy brother was a car salesman for awhile, so I have a pretty good idea how it goes. I was only given his personal cell number so he could make sure he got my sale instead of anyone else. I'm also an IT student, so I have a very hard time believing their servers were down for two whole weeks. Either they have the worst tech support in the history of ever, or I was put off so I wouldn't have to be offered a holiday deal. Plus, what, did you not check your voicemail?? \n\nMy experience here was beyond unprofessional. I'm glad, now, that I went where I did for my car. Berge only saw my business as a number. I will never shop with them.","date":"2015-01-03 21:02:26"}

It is a pretty good value and always delicious. Fresh naan is served upon arrival and the buffet always offers some type of chicken curry or masala and tandoori chicken,palak paneer, veggie curries, salad, sometimes goat curry and a few other options. It also has Chai, but it isn't good. I don't recommend coming for dinner. The menu is a la carte and a bit pricey for what you get. The portion sizes are very small and you don't get any rice or naan. We ordered a goat curry dish and chicken curry dish and there was only about 5-6 pieces of meat in the dish servings. They ran about $13-15 too! We expected a lot more for that price. I think rice and\/or naan should come standard with dishes here (especially in that price range). The service is always spectacular and super friendly.","date":"2017-05-13 05:44:56"}

Rex Marvin is that person. Rex Marvin's search for the greatest food and the most huffable gasoline makes him the tragic figure that in literature would get the girl, save the day, and have the most severed heads in jars in his basement (if it was a Disney book).  The good news people, is that all of those things in real life are true.  If you consider a graveside ditch near the freeway to be a \"basement\".  Rex does. Recently, Rex was accosted for no reason.  Rex and his woman, Three Legged Midget Maggie, were minding our own business.  Rex was casually tossing TLMM up in the air until she was able to grab onto a ledge and let herself in.  Rex tossed her and she didn't come down. A sure sign that TLMM has accomplished her mission. Rex turns around to have 4 metro cops staring at him. They were big. They were not smiling.  Rex decided to break the ice.  Rex asked \"How many buy one get one free garden hose or industrial blacktop sealant coupons does it take to get 4 cops to walk away and pretend like they saw nothing?\" The next thing Rex knew he saw flashes of light. Rex smiled. Darkness. Rex woke up on the floor of a squad car while the cops talked about the loser they beat and were taking into custody. It must have been someone else.\n\nRex's left eye was shut but he saw that they had stopped at a gas station. They talked about food. They were getting gas station pasta. The smaller one looked back to check on Rex, and said that he was in the mood for \"frozen noodles in sauce\". Rex closed his eyes and tried not to vomit at the idea. He felt with his food that the back door wasn't closed all the way. Rex dislocated his wrists, slipped off the cuffs, and pushed the door open...and much like the time Rex woke up in Candice Bergen's bedroom...he was out before something that could never been taken back happened.  Not going to jail...no Rex can do hard time...but smelling heated frozen pasta is something that Rex will not endure.  Rex has endured more than most. Remember, Rex lived in drag as Jodi Foster's lesbian lover for 3 years...Rex HAS ENDURED! Still everyone has a line not to cross. One of Rex's is frozen pasta...the other is participating in the underground black market 8 track tape racket...lucrative, but Rex only needs to lose 3 toes to know that some money just isn't worth it. Rex has brains.\n\nRex needed to cleanse himself from the memory of that awful experience...so Rex ran. He crawled. He climbed into someone's trunk. He eventually reached the closest place he could find...Manhattan Pizza.  It is in a strip mall behind a bank and near a place that sells fancy popcorn, and none of that bodes well...but ignore the warning signs and go in.\n\nThere are a few staples in an Italian restaurant, and one of them is the Chicken Parm. If you can't make a lights out Chicken Parm then you should close your doors. Manhattan makes a very good one. The chicken is tender, the batter is crispy, the mozzarella is good and the sauce is great. Their red sauce is excellent. Just the right amount of garlic and acidity. The pasta is always cooked well, never over cooked and mushy. The next is meatballs. Manhattan makes a very good meatball; it is almost all meat and no unnecessary fillers. Lastly, can it make a pizza...a great pizza...and Manhattan...excels! Rex is more the New York style pizza kind of man. If you like a doughy crust, you are a hick, and this place might not be for you. They do put a lot of toppings on it, and that is a good thing. \nThe truth about Manhattan is the same truth people say about Rex Marvin...almost everything is good.  There isn't too much Rex hasn't tried he didn't like. The fried foods are all good, with a nod to the mozzarella sticks.  The pastas are all good and have good sauces.  The Alfredo could have some more parmesan cheese in it for Rex's taste, but you shake some more on and it is good.  \n\nThe prices are too high. Period. The food is good, but Rex finds himself not going because for the same amount of money there are better options. If they dropped the prices Rex would eat there a lot more.\n\nThere are a lot worse places to go than Manhattan especially for the pizza. They do a very good job at New York style pizza, not perfect but a very good job.  They obviously care and try hard to make a quality product.  Sometimes they succeed better than others, but it is never awful. Rex can appreciate that. Just like Three Legged Midget Maggie, sometimes it takes a few throws, but she always tries. She always gives an effort...and in the end of the day...that means something.  Rex doesn't know what it means, but it means something.\n\nMahattan isn't Rex's first choice. It isn't even his second or third, but in a pinch it is good. It is really a 2 1\/2 star place. Order right, catch it on the right night, it can be very good. Normally it is just above good. For the money, you can do better than good.","date":"2012-03-01 00:26:47"}

The previous year I went, there were a lot fewer customers. However, despite being full, the cafe was quiet as people worked away or kept their nose behind the newspaper.

For those who still don't know what a rodizio is, I'm saving you a Google search: you pay an amount and waiters keep bringing you food until you say you're full or you explode, whatever happens first.\n\nI was expecting to eat just pizza, but they had a small pasta and salad buffet that was included in the price of $20\/person. The lasagna was awesome - of course I didn't try everything because I was there for the pizza, after all.\n\nThe pizza slices are smaller than normal so you can try many different kinds. The \"Portuguese\" (ham, cheese, egg, peas and onions) and the four cheese (mozzarella, parmesan, gorgonzola and catupiry) were the best ones, in my opinion.\n\nPlease, go ahead and make your reservation. You won't be sorry.","date":"2010-05-14 15:59:54"}

Keep in mind I also don't have health insurance because that is expensive as hell. \n\nI find this place and it has 5 stars. I call and this amazing nice lady answered the phone. I forgot her name unfortunately but she was so sweet. She told me to go in and the doctor would see me. \n\nI go in and immediately they start working on me. I apparently tore a muscle and that is why I was in pain and could not move my head! I was scared and I talked to Dr. Brandon Wentzel about the wedding I was going to be attending at 6 that day. He promised to make me better and that I would be able to move. \n\nGuess what? He did! I left the doctor place able to move and even though I still had pain it lowered from a 10 to 1! \n\nSO happy to have been able to go here and have two people take care of me and make me better.

I had Apple Cobbler and Carrot Cake with frozen Vanilla Yogurt (Ice Cream?) on top.  The quality of everything I ate was better than what is served at other Station Casinos.

This is my favourite  new restaurant of 2017. Aloette is the casual sister to Alo, upstairs. The room is long and narrow, and feels like a cross between a classic diner and an upscale train dining car. Waiters bustle around the tight space creating a fun, busy atmosphere.\n\nWe sat at the bar. No reservations are taken but we walked right in at 6:00.\n\nWe started with beef tartare and fried smelts. The tartare was good and went well with the fresh horseradish included. Smelts were crispy and lightly battered. A nice surprise were the fried jalapenos that went surprisingly well with the fish. The real star though was the free cheesy toast and butter.\n\nThe mains were absolutely delicious. The cornish hen was cooked perfectly crispy and was an umami explosion with mushrooms and spinach, but could have used a tiny bit more salt and\/or sauce. The burger with fried cheese on top was fantastic. Now that the Harbord Room is closed I think this is now my favourite restaurant burger in Toronto.\n\nFor dessert we had the apple pie sundae and a cup of strong coffee.\n\nService was impeccable.

The biggest issue was that there were only 2 waitresses who were both taking orders and serving food, which made the service very slow. The waitress took about 10 minutes to come around to our table and forgot to ask for what drinks we wanted until I mentioned it. In addition, it took a while to get either waitress' attention when we need ed napkins or extra utensils. Lastly, we had ordered the the Fried Ice Cream with Mango Ice Cream, however, our waitress failed to mention that they only had one flavor of ice cream. When we told her about the mistake, she just curtly explained that they only had one flavor in stock. It was just a frustrating experience.\n\nOverall, the food was good, but the service lacking.

My boyfriend went to U of I and we somehow stumbled upon this hidden gem. Well, I suppose it's not so hidden since there is usually a long wait. But don't be discouraged! The wait is well worth it, I promise. \n\nTry to make your way through the door, find the guy in charge, and put your name on the list. There's not much space in this place. I guess that would be my one complaint. It can get pretty crunched, especially if you're waiting. However, what is better to tide you over than a delicious beer? Now, let's talk about this beer.\n\nThey have new selections on tap all the time. Please, do your beer pallet a favor and don't order the usual domestics and imports (Miller, Bud, Heiniken, Corona, etc). Those are just fine for any regular restaurant. Why miss the glorious opportunity to try something mind-blowingly good? Seriously, these beers are amazing. They come from different breweries across the country. Places\/companies you've never heard of. Combinations of flavors you would never think to try. I once had an oyster beer here. Sounds disgusting but it was so good. Trust me on that. I'm very picky and I liked it. You can also get a flight of 7 beers on a dogbone shaped tray (how fitting!). This flight has all the beers that are on tap in 4 oz glasses. You can share them with a friend and then order the one you like best!\n\nNow, on to the food. So SO good. There are a few different sauce choices you can get. Not being one for spicy, I get the Georgia Peach. It is soo good on anything you get. There is no bad item on this menu. The pulled pork is amazing as are the hamburgers. Hard to believe a hamburger could be so good, but it is. The brisket is also amazing. They cook it for 12 hours. How could it not be? Try to get here relatively early though, because some items like the brisket run out later in the evening. While it's a bummer, think of it as a good thing. This way, you know they're not just heating it in the microwave. They cook it, and once it's gone, it's gone. Oh and the fries are amazing, whether you get the regular or sweet potato.\n\nI know this was a long review, but I really can't say enough about this place. I'm obsessed. It's a bummer that my bf graduated so we can't go all the time since we live near Chicago. However, I will make any excuse to go down. Going there this weekend for Halloween.

The Gyro was indeed huge and the meat was flavorful but the veggies were close to the end of their shelf life. The fries that came with the meal were crap actually, I know that they are fresh cuts fries so lets make sure that they are cooked all the way through and have some sort of uniformity in size and the oil that they were fried in was obviously fairly old.

After moving to Ahwatukee from Central Phoenix a couple of years ago, this location became the closest to me. It used to be reliable and consistent but the last several times I've been, the quality has really suffered. \n\nA few months ago I ordered some take-out for my family.  After getting it home and going to eat my meal, I realized that my order was very wrong.  Now I'd become accustomed to this location forgetting things like sauces for the appetizers, napkins, soy sauce and fortune cookies (things that are supposed to be included with take-out), but my dish was inedible to me.  \n\nI called to complain, the manager was apologetic and offered that I come back and pick up a replacement OR he would send me a gift card to replace my meal.  Since I have an infant that I needed to get to bed, I opted for the gift card.\n\nA month or so went by and my husband suggested Pei Wei.  That's when I realized that I never received the replacement gift card!  We ordered and when my husband picked it up, he mentioned the issue we had the last time and they gave him a discount.  As usual, things were missing from the order (no appetizer sauce, napkins, fortune cookies, etc.) and the food was just okay.\n\nTonight we ordered again, this time the food was just horrible.  Bland, no taste whatsoever for either of our dishes!  I ordered the new Korean BBQ with chicken (I had it before) and really liked it.  My husband had the same but with tofu and vegetables.  Neither of us thought the food was good at all.  The sauce which is normally very tasty was so bland and watery that it literally ran off of the chicken.  The 'salad' that comes with it was wilted and soggy, clearly not fresh.

It's a little piece of King West transplanted at College and Yonge. Above Toronto's landmark breakfast place Fran's, Screen Lounge is a 2-level resto-lounge - I can see hanging out in the sleek indoor bar area this winter, but during this extremely hot summer, it's the roof-top patio all the way. It's got a huge outdoor seating area, comfortable and modern red-and-black-cushioned patio furniture and back-lit bar that looks very Miami as the sun goes down. The chill-out music sounding from the speakers adds to that 'sit-here-and-chillax-for-as-long-as-you-want' vibe.\n\nPrices are a bit steep for this area (like I said, think King West!) but the staff is super-attentive and the food portions are a good size.  They've got some creative sushi rolls (try the Canadian, wrapped in bacon) and tasty tempura appetizers. It would be great if you could order Fran's brunch on the rooftop patio on a Saturday or Sunday morning...I hope that is in the works!\n\nThe lounge is pretty new, so it was quiet, but I can see it picking up once word gets around.

AVOID ANY OF THE FRIED ITEMS on the menu since it's pretty obvious they never change their cooking oil and everything tastes the same-- terrible-- and is WAY over-cooked.

Also, the restaurant offers both their brunch and lunch menu at this time, which offer many more authentic choices than just their dinner menu.\n\nIf it's spring in Vegas, I order the Moules Frites, mussels in white wine butter sauce with crusty baguette, a light and delicious classic that Marche does well; don't forget the Mimosa.  \n\nIf it's summer, I order the lobster avocado croissant, pair it with a Riesling from the market; the sweetness of the Riesling highlights the lobster and brings out the richness of the avocado.  \n\nIf it's fall, I order the duck confit & fettucini pasta, it's a calorie splurge but completely worth it.  \n\nAnd if it's winter, I get the Les Oeufs En Meurette, three perfect poached eggs in hearty red wine sauce with ham and mushrooms; it's a dish that warms your stomach, and your heart; break some rules and order a glass of Cotes Du Rhone with it: red wine works for daytime when it's Vegas harsh dry winter.\n\nDessert is their weakness.

It was served with potato chips and a side order of POTATO SALAD??  and a pickle.   Talk about a starch redundancy!

At first, I was really turned off by the \"tex-mex\" concept and even the name \"Mesa Grill\" didn't sound too appetizing, but we took a risk... and Bobby delivered.  We came here for my husband's 27th birthday and he had a wonderful time.\n\nSERVICE: \n5 Solid Stars!  The hostesses sat our party right away even though not everyone was there.  We were immediately served water and asked if we wanted any cocktails.  I really loved our waiter.  He wasn't just polite and attentive, but he was also engaging us in wonderful conversation throughout our meal.  He talked to us about how long he had been working there, and what Bobby's like... and he knew the menu like the back of his hand.  It was like having a new friend dine with us throughout the duration of our meal.  I wish I caught his name so I can give him props!\n\nFOOD:\nBread Basket - 2 stars.  They start you off with a variety of breads.  There was a jalapeno one, another one with some blue corn in it, and a third one that I can't recall.  All were very unique, but unfortunately, I wasn't a fan.  I didn't think the bread was very soft or moist, and the flavors didn't do it for me.  Kudos for thinking outside the box though.  The butter also wasn't the soft, spreadable kind.\n\nBlue Corn Pancake - 5 stars.  This appetizer came highly recommended by our server.  There was barbecued duck inside pancake (like a glorified taco), and a habanero chili star-anise sauce drizzled all over it.  The flavors all worked so well together to deliver an explosion of flavors in my mouth.\n\nSpanish Chorizo Quesadilla - 4 stars.  This was larger than expected!  It is pretty filling and could easily be substituted for a meal as a filler.  Or you can split this between 2-3 people and share it as an appetizer.  It's a pretty heavy dish and hard to eat too much of.  There's a large fried egg on top of a tortilla.  Embedded in the tortilla is smoked tomato salsa, grilled green onion, and crispy artichokes.  \n\nFor our entree, my husband and I shared the New Mexican Spice-Rubbed Pork Tenderloin even though I was realllly eyeing the 22 ounce bone-in Ribeye.  The waiter said the pork tenderloin was their signature dish so that's why we ordered it even though I'm not a huge fan of pork.  It wasn't until the dish arrived that we were convinced we had made the right choice!!  WOW, that was one tender, delicious, savory, melt-in-your-mouth piece of meat.  The spice rub added a bit of heat, and I can easily say this is the best piece of pork I've ever been served.  It came with a side of the most amazing tamale.  I can't even begin to describe how good it was.  You just have to try it.  5 Stars for this entire dish!!!\n\nI sampled some of the other dishes from my friends, but the pork dish was the definite standout.  My friend ordered the lamb chops, but they tasted a bit gamey and weren't as tender as they could've been.  The pan seared Halibut was tender and flaky paired with a lovely curry spice reduction.  I'd give both these dishes 4 stars.  \n\nAll in all a wonderful experience.  Glad I finally got to try one of Bobby's restaurants!","date":"2010-07-07 19:41:57"}

His emblazoned name means some tasty meats, let me tell you.   But this restaurant has done nothing for Mr. Flay's Southwestern recipes.  \n\nA friend and I had lunch at MESA today, and before I get into the gory details, let me say the wait staff and bus service was very great.  Helpful on all sorts of problems;   for instance, there was a bug that crawled out of my friend's salad, stretched its little bug legs, and sat around for a minute while we waved down the help. \n\n  We assumed the bug had been knocked senseless by the over-seasoning of the lamb in the Cobb salad.  And over-seasoning is ridiculous here!   My pork tenderloin sandwich with Southwestern fries was like being double-teamed by rubs and seasoning salt.  Now the tenderloin was tender, but like my friend's lamb, there was no tasting of anything but chilis. \n\n  Without like an aioli or some kind of dill yogurt to give your mouth a rest, it all just blends into generic spice tastes.    Adding in the heavyness of the dishes such as the recommended goat cheese queso fundido (Which was very delicious, but served with generic and easily breaking nachos)  you are left queazy and overfilled.\n\n20 minutes after our meal, on which the salad was comped and we were given free creme brulees (chocolate toffee, so rich and creamy), I began to feel very ill.   I ended up doubled-over in a forums restroom, the final and worst part of it all.\n\nI think of it as a science experiment, and sometimes science produces great things.  Sometimes you irradiate yourself.  This was more of the latter.   A lot of nice little things, such as the help and appetizers, but outweighed by a couple unforgivable offenses.   I also don't like a meal so poorly spiced that it causes my body to actually reject it.  \n\nSorry Bobby, maybe you should return and retune.","date":"2010-08-20 22:26:25"}

Most recently I called in an order for sushi take out. When picking up my order, I asked the attendant (whom I later found out was the manager) for some low sodium soy sauce. He seemed annoyed that I asked, grabbed a small, unmarked clear plastic container and handed it to me. Upon arriving home to enjoy my meal, I noticed an odd fishy smell about my food. Noooo! After a couple of bites of sushi I had to stop and toss it --- the rolls tasted like funky fish! I called Akahana and spoke with the manager who gave me the soy sauce, and while he offered to make some new sushi for me, I didn't take him up on it. I also didn't ask for a refund. I did however ask him to visit his kitchen and investigate why my two different sushi rolls shared the same fishy taste and smell. I suspected it was the rice or the nori, but who knows. I'm sad to say it because I love supporting Plaza Midwood businesses, but I will be taking a break from this spot for a while. I hope things improve.","date":"2014-03-14 06:20:44"}

I enjoyed my appointments with Dr. Strain and found her to be knowledgable and attentive. However, I was incredibly displeased with how I was treated by the staff. I went through my vision insurance with a staff member and assumed this information was added to my file. I called a month or so later to order contacts and was told I could not pay for the contacts when I came and picked them up; I needed to pay for them over the phone. I have never paid for contacts before picking them up before but I figured it wasn't a big deal, just differences between offices. Once I got the statement for my order, I realized that they had charged me the full amount and not run anything through my insurance company. I called back and was met with no answers, saying they would call me back later. They never did, so I called back again and finally learned that my vision insurance had never been added to my file. After going through my information a second time, they then assured me they would file a claim with my insurance company and I would receive a check soon. Never once in this back and forth did anyone from the staff apologize or recognize that they had made a mistake. In fact, everyone I talked to seemed more agitated that they now had to reprocess the claim. A month later, I received my refund along with an updated billing statement. Amongst the revised patient\/insurance payment was a statement describing why the revision was necessary. It read: \"patient originally did not say to use insurance and paid in full for contacts-decided a few days later she would like us to bill vsp and refund her the remaining balance\". This is the first medical establishment I have come in contact with that required me to advise them of my desire to use my medical insurance. Professional medical establishments run benefit checks and inform the customer of their costs prior to performing the service. While I feel Dr. Strain is a highly qualified ophthalmologist, I am exceedingly disappointed in the professionalism and efficiency of the office staff. At this point, I do not see myself returning in the future.","date":"2018-04-04 00:37:04"}

The Abbey seemed to fulfill all necessary criteria.  The criteria being: patio, beer and tasty food.  \nWell, it had two of the three, however, those two were not enough to redeem this place, especially in light of the laughably awful service.\nNow, I'll admit that three of the people in our party got their food and enjoyed it.  However, two of us were not so lucky.  \nFirst we were given the wrong food.  The one other person who ordered at the same time as us (we sort of ordered in two shifts) got his food.  They took back our messed up orders, with the excuse that the computer wasn't working and thus the orders were messed up...uh okay.  Twenty minutes later we recieved the food we ordered, just as our friend was finishing his meal.  Unfortunately, my greek salad came topped with fetid feta cheese and the caesar wrap came complete with bugs squished on the lettuce.  \nThe good news was that the food was comped.  However, it took us a little too long to pay as the debit machine phone line was being used by a disgruntled employee to complain about her employment situation and to utter expletives in that regard.\nNeedless to say we won't go back.  There are too many awesome restaurants and patios to waste any more time there.  \nWe did enjoy the beautiful sunshine though : )","date":"2009-05-20 13:47:18"}

Everything from Vanilla Cinnamon to Cotton Candy. And of course to celebrate the holidays, they also have Egg Nog and Pumpkin Flavours. Oh, and did I mention that you get to choose mixins?!?!? So not ONLY do you get to pick the flavour of ice cream you want, but you get to pick the mixins you want mixed in. We're talkin anything from chocolate bar pieces, to fresh fruit. So it's basically like a blizzard or a Yogen Fruz but in a cone, and with the freshest, most delicious ice cream you can imagine. Once you've picked your ice cream flavour and your mixins, they mash everything up right in front of you on a frozen counter. Then once it's all perfectly mixed, they scoop it into a cone (or a cup of you prefer) and you're good to go.\n\nI haven't even mentioned yet that they also sell cakes, take-home pints, shakes, floats, smoothies and frozen yogurt.\n\nI know, RIGHT?!?!??!\n\nIf you hadn't guessed it already, I'm definitely a fan.

The young lady who did my pedicure was very sweet, attentive and friendly.

Therefore all the mediocre reviews below should take into account that this property is in transition.  I first stayed here back in the 80's and gradually watched it deteriorate.  So its current condition is great in comparison.   The rooms no longer look like photos 11 and 12 posted above. The rest are up to date.\n\n* Positives:  Flat screen TV's on wood laminate TV walls, furniture has been updated since the photos posted, IKEA lighting, temperature controls in each room (but older units), very clean and loved the wood flooring over nasty hotel carpeting.  The current internet rate is $72\/night.  How can you beat that in a central Toronto location? I like that you need to use your room key to move the elevator. This stops strangers from accessing the upper floors as the desk can't see the elevators.  There is a security guard on at night.  A concierge will also be located in the lobby in the future. \n\n* Negatives:  The awful drapery and the bathroom still needs some improvement.  The room is small but no different than any other budget hotel.  The lobby and restaurant are being renovated so you have to deal with that.  Paying $10 a day for wireless is a bit too much.\n\nI would stay here again.  Another plus, the Airport Express bus stops right at the door taking you to Pearson aiport for $20 (or $18 online).","date":"2010-01-08 02:38:45"}

This was a pre-opening tasting, so they're still working on all of the fine points.  Nonetheless, it is a terrific spot.  The structure itself is very appealing, as they restored a 1940's-era building and exposed its beautiful brickwork, which is complimented with a stained concrete floor.  The bar is a proper one with a wide array of liquors and fairly ample seating for the size of the space.  The patio definitely will be the preferred seating choice so long as the weather cooperates.  We tried macaroni and cheese as well as the cole slaw starters; for $3 each, you could make a delicious, reasonably-priced meal from a collection of the starters.  The double dip starter (cobb dip and posole salsa with chips) was very good, though I almost preferred the dip and salsa without the chips because they're so flavorful.  The mixed grain salad was a good choice, too, though I might try to find something other than the orange vinagrette to put on it.  The wine on tap was tasty, and they'll also have a small list of about 8 bottles.  Again, the official opening isn't until the 25th, so they're still honing the fine edges.  In any event, we'll be there far too often for our own good!","date":"2011-04-22 14:18:46"}

Boy was I mistaken.  The parking lot was jammed and therefore forced to eat in the lounge without a reservation.  In the end, probably a better choice.  The lounge, though seperate, actually shares the main dining room's huge picture window view of the heavily forested ravine and Cahoon Creek.  The rustic decorating and dark tones with a glowing fireplace makes you think you might be in a roaring 20's hideaway.  The bartender was a pro - courteous, efficient, \"healthy\" drink pourer.  The lounge menu struck us as pricey at first but fears were quelled when our neighbor's order arrived.  We opted for the steak sandwiches which came with potato or salad. Prepared perfectly and just enough to satisfy. We felt very good about our choices all around.  I was taken by the sheer number of people and traffic when compared to the prices, Cleveland economy and aforementioned new options.

The most incredibly unprofessional establishment I have EVER been to. Not only are their prices stupid expensive but they do a terrible job! I think it is pretty pathetic when i can do my own nails and they look much better than someone who is supposed to be a licensed professional. When I went the other day not only were my nails not straight but the technician (Her name was Lin I believe)  flied the skin off the sides of my fingers and made them BLEED!! When i said \"uhm I am bleeding\" she wiped the blood off (not gently) and tried to act as if it did not happen. I was still charged full price even after being injured! I walked out literally crying because my fingers were burning in so much pain. Later my fiance and I went back to speak with the manager\/owner about the situation and he LAUGHED TO OUR FACE!!! He did not apologize, all he said is that he would fix it, but last time I checked you cannot just magically heal someones cut fingers. When I asked to see the license of the technician he said \"I do not have to show you that\". I find it highly likely that he refused to show us the license because she probably does not have one. There is so much more I could say about how awful they were but I think people should get the idea. I WOULD NOT EVER SUGGEST ANYONE GO HERE!","date":"2017-12-16 05:04:07"}

Tonight on our way back from the hospital and being Labour Day we thought we would call them to see if they were open. So I got Siri going and got the number. I dialed it and asked if they were open. The lady on the phone said that they were very busy and that I should make a reservation. I did and off we went. When we got there the first clue that something was amiss was that the place was nearly deserted and they could not find my reservation. We took our seat and proceeded to order. Not five minutes into this and we get a call from a local number, it was the first restaurant we called wondering where we were. As it turns out the owners of Cynthia's created a tangent restaurant called Cynthia's Paradise and put it literally right next door. Talk about confusing your market. Given the way the night was going to unfurl we should have packed up and gone next door.\n\nI ordered the Hot and Sour Soup to start. This is one of my favourites and when I looked at the $4.95 price tag I assumed we were going to get a bowl big enough to share. When it came I got this little golden globe before me which revealed inside an even smaller ceramic bowl which if it held 1 cup of soup I would have been amazed. The soup was adequate. It has a nice balance of all the flavours I am used to but in no way was this worth 5 dollars. I mean for just one dollar more at another chinese restaurant I got a bowl of soup so large that it would have filled that little bowl before me 20 times over. What really drove the point home though was the little tiny $3.50 Egg Roll and the 2 HarGow for $4.50. This place was way over priced. So maybe the service was going to be exceptional. I mean, there were more people on the floor, behind the counter and that could be seen in the kitchen than there were patrons sitting at the tables. The 2 HarGow came one at a time in the tiniest steam boxes I have ever seen. We ordered Moo Shu Pork, Chinese Broccoli and the House Special Fried Rice. The food took way longer to get to us than was comfortable for me but taste wise it was very good. Far too expensive but very good. Ended the meal with the Deep Fried Creme Brulee and with a 13% tip the meal came out to $94.75.\n\nFrankly I can think of a number of places that I would like to spend that kind of money for 2 people. Cynthia's Chinese Restaurant is no longer one of those. As a comparison the meal at Cynthia's Paradise would have cost $54 for two people all you can eat. I will do a review of Paradise when I go there but this place will never see another dime from me.","date":"2016-09-06 02:10:35"}

I didn't know that for a long time and I'm disappointed that I spent so much money buying my liquor at supermarkets.  Now that I've discovered Total Wine it is pretty much my sole stop for not only wine but beer (I am incredibly non-loyal to beer brands, I like to try new beers from all of the world).  I also stock up on my hard alcohol at Total Wine and have recently discovered they have a decent selection of cigars.\n\nThe store is pleasant, with kind of a woodsy warehouse feeling to it.  Most of the staff are knowledgeable and pleasant.  The prices across the board are reasonable.  They have long hours and tons of parking.  Maybe the only slight downside is they chose to locate in Desert Ridge, which is not a mall that is easy to just pop in to.  I think Desert Ridge is more suited to stores like Target, to the movie theaters, and to the food court than to a food\/liquor store that I might want to go to for one or two items every few days.","date":"2012-11-06 17:17:16"}

I'm so glad that I did when I arrived this hidden gem in a not so busy neighbourhood. \n\nWe ordered cheese Jalapeño for starter, osso buco and braised lamb for main. Everything was delicious!!!! So richly infused with all kinds of spices! The cheese jalapeño looks a little unpleasant under the red neon light, but after the first bite, we are totally sold!! Both osso buco and braised lamb come with tostadas and beans and rice, no need to order separately. The portion was quite generous for two girls, next time we will probably cut one main and do one more starter. \n\nMy only criticism would be the size of the table. For Mexican food, it'd be great if we have a little bigger table for the many dishes. But I understand that it is built upon a small townhouse, won't be able to have so many people if the table is bigger. \n\nAdvise before going: \n\n1,it's going to be fully packed, make your reservation early. \n2, it's going to be loud, don't expect to sit in a quite corner. \n3, ask the waiter for recommendation, they give great tips!","date":"2018-04-15 14:42:51"}

By far the worst experience I have ever had in Vegas. \n\nTypically hotels in Vegas are known for being extremely catering to their guests. This was not the case. Plus the whole hotel looks like absolute crap filled with the scummiest people. \n\nNext, my room was absolutely filthy. There were piss stains running down the toilet to the ground, it also smelled like someone died in my room. The bed felt like I should have brought a black light and possibly a hazmat suit. Best part about my room was the AC actually working, but the shower\/tub looked like someone had just washed their cars undercarriage in it. The towels felt like sand paper and were barely large enough to be considered bath towels....more like hand towels. Getting a cab is nearly impossible since no where does it say you are required to tell the front desk to call a cab or just call it yourself, since they don't employ someone at the entrance to wave cabs for you. Their room service isn't insanely over priced like most Vegas hotels, but there's a reason for that, everything tastes like it had been made 24-48 hours earlier.\n\nLastly and most importantly, after surviving 3 nights in this dump, I was brushing my teeth the following morning when I noticed a fairly large cockroach scamper across the sink.\n\nAfter all this I literally slept at my friends hotel the final night to avoid puking in my own mouth or getting some rare form of malaria.\n\nIf I told you how much I paid to stay at this sh*thole, you would kick me in the d*ck for being such a dumbass. \n\nIn the end I feel like I got raped for my hard earned cash just so I could save a little. Definitely learned my lesson and going to spend the extra cash to stay at a real hotel next time.","date":"2014-07-13 15:06:35"}

In fact just thinking about Savoy makes my mouth water a little, that's how much I love Savoy.\n\nThe first time I sampled some bites from Savoy was at a Yelp event last year; unfortunately it took me quite a long time to make my way back, but I after the meal I had last week I think the wait was worth it. I went here for dinner with a family member on a Wednesday night - as a result the place was pretty quiet when we arrived. After checking our coats (this is more or less mandatory as they don't let you drape them over the chairs) we were seated at one of their comfy downstairs lounge tables, and we explored the menu, ordered, and proceeded to enjoy an excellent meal.\n\nFirstly, there was the fresh free bread with oil and balsamic for dipping. I was quite hungry so this was a great start. One note, though - beware the spicy bread! We're pretty sure jalapenos were baked into a couple pieces. Tasty for some, not ideal for people like me though.\n\nThen there was the drinks. My dining companion ordered a blackberry Cosmo (made with ingredients like blackberry moonshine - quite a nice touch), and I ordered the Starburst. Both of these drinks were superb; the Cosmo was a first-rate drink and oddly enough, my Starburst did indeed remind me of Starburst candies - but was still muuuuch tastier!\n\nAs for the food - just, YUM! My companion ordered tomato soup and a pear salad. The salad was flavorful (though pretty standard in terms of salad ingredients), and the tomato soup was simply amazing - in addition to its freshness and being the perfect thickness it came with grilled cheese sandwich squares instead of croutons. More restaurants need to do this with their tomato soup, it was just so good! As for me, I ordered the 2015 restaurant week special - hen with bacon mac and cheese and a side of kale - and this was simply divine. I have yet to find such tender, juicy and well seasoned chicken in the city, plus the mac and cheese wasn't overly cheesy and had the bacon flavor infused into it. The result was that it wasn't too rich and it went well with my chicken and kale. The entire meal was also served with a side of tomato gravy, which was basically a thicker version of the tomato soup I'd sampled and fallen in love with already. I couldn't have been happier with what I ordered.\n\nThe clincher for our excellent meal was the fantastic service we received throughout the night. All in all we thought Savoy had amazing food, fantastic staff and a very chill but warm atmosphere. We would absolutely come back - hopefully my next meal here will involve sampling the amazing looking brunch menu!","date":"2015-01-18 18:49:53"}

I just purchased a 2011 Chevrolet Malibu from this dealership, and I went here after work to pick up the green slip so I can register the car with the DMV. \nTIP: Customers who buy or lease vehicles here: DO NOT have to go to the DMV to register your vehicle. You simply use the dealerships control number on the green slip to enter in the DMV website and it will bring up the vehicle you bought. You can then transfer or request new plates (standard only plates) and the DMV will mail them to you. This is handy, because we ALL hate the DMV. \n\nBack to my review of AutoNation Buick GMC of West Sahara round 2. So I got the green slip and I was \"just looking\" at some of the Buicks on the lot. Buick has come along way in the last 10 years or so. This is NOT your grandfather's or grandmother's Buick anymore. I had a 2013 LEXUS ES 300h that got 39MPG highway and 40MPG city. It had quite a few bells and wistles. Anyway, I began by driving a V6 powered 2016 Buick Lacrosse and Devon and Denzell were my points of contact again. I really liked it. This one didn't have the same equipment that my Lexus does, so I didn't really want this particular car, as I didn't want to go down in car quality or caliber. Then I drove a 2014 Chevrolet Impala V6, and loaded with everything for that model year with 22k miles and they were asking 25k for it. I really liked this car. It wasn't a Lexus or a Buick, but it was cheaper than either one of those and it was fully loaded. But I was contemplating replacing my business car, which was my Lexus, and I already had a V6 powered Malibu that I bought for 16k with 32.5k miles two weeks earlier from this same dealership, and the same sales people (Devin and Denzell). It took me forever to decide even after driving a brand new 2015 Buick Lacrosse that had just about everything my Lexus did minus the front parking sensors and the dash cam, but I can replace the dash cam later (which I will at this dealership for both my Malibu and Lacrosse). I got a Heads Up display system with forward collision alert, I got a Bose audio system, a panoramic sun roof, remote starter system, and a wifi hotspot powered by onstar. These features my Lexus didn't have. \n\nI was given multiple options, and a lot of time to decide which vehicle I wanted out of the three, the Chevrolet Impala, or the 2015 V4 eAssist Buick or the 2016 V6 Buick. I ultimately chose the 2015 eAssist V4 Buick Lacrosse based upon what I was going to be doing with the car, showing Real Estate. I was offered an unbelieveable deal too. Because this vehicle was a 2015, and was sitting in the showroom, and the 2016's were already here and more were coming, this car was priced at 35k. Originally it was 41k which was understandable. If I bought my Lexus ES 300h brand new, it would have been 47k easy. I know cars, and how to shop for the ones I like or want. So I knew I was getting a deal on this new car. Also, I was given a 2k tax credit for my Lexus, and AutoNation gave me another $800.00 off on the car, because I am a repeat buyer, and I didn't waste anyone's time. Thank you David! \n\nSo I still had 1k of negative equity to deal with, and that was done by lowering my interest rate from 4.9% with Lexus to 3.9% through AutoNation Buick GMC's contacts. Can you say Credit Unions anyone? If you want great financing go see the fine people at AutoNation Buick GMC, they WILL find you a good deal, if it takes all day. They don't just use traditional banks or manufacturer banks like most dealerships do, which all charge higher interest rates, trust me I've been there. \n\nSo in combination of lowering the interest rate again to 3.45%, and further dropping the price of the new 2015 Buick Lacrosse, I wrapped up my negative equity and came UP about 2k. This shows in the contract as down payment money which is true because I verified how the dealership got the numbers. So I got a brand new Buick Lacrosse, with an extended warranty, prepaid oil changes for 3 years on top of the 2 years given to you by GM (General Motors), theft protection and GAP insurance and my payments are $616.00 per month versus $647.00 a month with Lexus without the theft protection, or the prepaid maintance plans. Lexus doesn't offer standard oil changes for the first 2 years either. \n\nWhat's more, my Buicks engine, transmission, and final point of assembly are in the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. Just like my 2011 Chevrolet Malibu. The major components of these cars are made here. Just read the window sticker, it will tell you where the major components are made. We need jobs in this country badly. I don't need Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump to \"bring back the jobs\" to the United States.

Like life or death people.\n\nWHAT I GOT: Cheese ribs\n\nPROS: Repeat after me. You can NEVER go wrong with meat and cheese. EVER. And my goodness, James Cheese Back Ribs is winning the restaurant game. You get a pool of gooey cheese that the server wraps around each rib along with extra corn, two different mashes (sweet potato and regular potato), mini sausages, and scrambled eggs. The ribs themselves were coated in this beautiful and super flavorful sauce, and the meat was super tender as well. Literally fell off the bone with one bite. They also give you scissors and some plastic gloves to keep your hands clean, along with the option to choose the heat level of your ribs. We went with mild, which honestly is not spicy at all, so if you're looking for even a little bit of a kick, I would suggest the regular spicy option.\n\nCONS: Ok well the price is pretty hefty. Not gonna lie. And the sides aren't exactly the most tasty things ever but combined with the cheese, usually anything will taste good. But be warned, the server will turn off the gas stove that melts the cheese once all the ribs are wrapped so the cheese will start to get hard again. If you wanna dip your sides, eat those first. And the ribs are a bit on the small side so this meal won't actually fill you up, if that's what you're looking for.","date":"2017-10-02 02:17:24"}

The original bibimbap was yummy (nothing extraordinary but solid and at least normal portion size).  The chocolate lava cake was delicious.  Warm and gooey. \n\nThe not so good: side dishes were icky.  So sad because half the fun of Korean food are the yummy side dishes.  The seafood pancake was tiny and for $9.50, so not worth it.   We are normally huge fans of seafood pancake but just so tiny here (two small silver dollar pancake size ones and at most places you get one the size of a dinner plate).   The pork belly app was so so.  \n\nOur waitress was really nice though it took a while to get seated and for someone to come and take our order.  \n\nOverall: small portions, pretty good service...

PEKING MAN in large, faux-Asian font on a bright red back drop. That's definitely a holdover from the 70s or 80s. After struggling to find an actual entrance (you see, it may be listed as being on Sheppard, but you have to turn on Ambrose to actually get to the storefront. If you're heading east and miss Ambrose, there's no chance to U-turn til Leslie, unless you want to run over city-owned flowers in the median.), we finally parked the car in front of some convenience store in the same strip mall\/mini-industrial park building area. Given the PEKING MAN sign is all you can see from the main road, I don't know how other businesses can persist here. \n\nThe moment we went past the doors, we were greeted with a motorcycle arcade machine. What is this, Chuck E. Chan? Ah ha, ha., there's a Chuck E. Cheese down the road. A waitress came up and we were promptly seated and presented with these ghastly menus, with cartoon depictions of, presumably, a Peking man in various states of labour (labour as in work, not Chinamen giving birth!).\n\nOn to the food! A family of five orders the following for dinner: Bamboo and Dried Scallop Soup, Deep-fried Soft Shell Crab, Peking Duck Special, Lobster fried in salt and pepper, and Shanghai Noodles with beef. I'll spare you the details, because there are no details. It was all bland. It was as if everything was frozen for Walt Disney's first meal after being brought back to life from his cryogenic sleep. The soup wasn't watered down, but it tasted like it was. The crab and the lobster were fried in the same tasteless junk probably used to grease door hinges. The duck was somewhat of a saving grace. First course, slightly crispy duck skin (though not nearly crispy enough to my liking), with fine slices of duck meat, to be wrapped in rice paper. Spare yourself from attack of the living bland and eat the duck straight up without the wrapping. Second course, stir-fried duck meat. More meh. Basically, anything these guys actually cook gets turned from gold into lead.\n\nAriel G. may want to take that trip down memory lane, but this meal was a memory I'd rather repress.","date":"2009-10-14 05:44:40"}

EXTREME pain right now. Got a Saturday ( today visit). I told the front desk BEFORE I went back that I didn't get paid until Wednesday ( a few days), and that I just paid to fix my roof so money is tight. After being examined and X rayed they explained what they could do and that my portion would be $160. They weren't sure they could even help m today as Phan's schedule was tight. I told them I could only pay $100 today. I was told by their office manager they don't do payment plans , they could try and get me some dental credit plan. I told them I didn't want to do that. It was $160 today or nothing. I told them I was unable to do that. So I came in pain , left in pain- they did nothing for me - I offered to pay my bill (around $60) as I left. They wanted to bill my insurance etc but I didn't want to hear from them again so I insisted I pay it all now because I wanted nothing to do with them ( contact me after insurance etc). . I complained  and to shut me up they wiped the bill clean. \n\nThey are all about the money. My $100 today plus insurance ( and $60 in 3 business days) wasn't enough to help me.

They don't care if you hurt. They are very high tech - and I understand they need to pay off all their high tech equipment - \n\nMy opinion : Pham sucks!

It's just white collar crime - they knew exactly my finances before I even went to a room , and then after exam it was \"pay up or get out\" - the officer manager specifically said \"we do not do payment plans\". \n\nThey wasted my one day off when I could have found someone who would help me when I am in severe pain \n\n\n===== \n\nAddendum 7\/1\/16 \n\nYep ...

This place doesn't look like much, I have to say.  And it was a bit hot inside, I can imagine as the summer warms up, so will this place.   The food did take a little while to come, and I didn't quite understand what our options were.  When we were seated, the waitstaff asked us if we wanted a menu or if we wanted the daily specials we should speak to the chef.  We didn't know what we wanted so we opted for the menu.  Those more familiar with the place seemed to understand and ordered specials which came out much faster then our cooked to order requests.  Lesson learned.  I had the chicken souvlaki dinner which was HUGE.  It came with an amazing greek salad to start and then I substituted cooked veggies for the potatoes.  For $14 it was an amazing amount of food that you could easily have shared between two people.\n\nLoved it.  Loved my leftovers.  Would definitely return.","date":"2015-06-08 18:05:35"}

Corned in small cubes, potatoes about the same size.  Peppers and onions.  with your style of egg on top.

I haven't been during happy hour, as it seems the place is bursting at the seems waiting for a Fire Marshall to be called. It might be best to go during that hour or so if you're trying to have more than one beverage at this place. \n\nAnyways, it's a dueling piano bar with two fella's who know all the bangin' hits from the 50's all the way up to today's Top 40. A patron can request a song (once one ends and \/ or hasn't been interrupted) and if someone in the crowd isn't pleased - he or she then has the opportunity to walk up to the the non-playing pianist, offer a cash tip of higher cash value than that placed prior and have the song changed on the spot.. keeping both the patrons and musicians on their toes. It's really an interactive environment - in the sense that the pianists continuously receive requests, talk to the crowd, with the crowd itself shootin' the breeze, minglin', singing and dancing if they know the jam being performed. If you can't see the performers, they have tv's lined up throughout the bar so you can catch a glimpse. I'm not the tallest human, so it's often I end up in somebody's armpit while they're singing their favorite track and I'm gasping for air. Kidding, I'm actually the guy who has YOU in the headlock; You'll be blissfully swept away by my beautiful renditions of Bohemian Rhapsody, I Want You To Want Me & my jam - One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer in an overtly joyous manner. \n\n*They also have that lady you see at all the shows.. she dances & looks like Dee from It's Always Sunny, tries to get you to boogey with her and you can't understand what she's saying, though, she sings every song on cue without a slur.  She's an interesting human who needs help, so you push her towards the random person next to you hoping they'll do something about it. Do some people observing and find em'! \n\nThis is a place of action, sound and movement. You might get bumped or pulled to dance and sing.

I bought 2 Groupons and waited two weeks to get my pre-paid for appointment (1 set for one house 2nd set for another). #1 was scheduled for a Thurs-Fri two weeks later and house #2 the third Thurs-Fri. I got a call from Jimmy on Mon-Tues of the Thurs before House #1 was to be completed putting me off another  week (now we're in week 3).  I had two potential buyers come by that weekend to see house #1. They went with the other house on my block because of my ugly brown paint (that I had scheduled to be done)!\n\nFinally my long-awaited for Thursday came and Jimmy showed up with two men promptly at 7:00 and gave me the trip charge, charge for baseboards, and for an extra room.  It was VERY fair.  The men did a good job... maybe an 8-9 and cleaned up well.  They had to schedule my 2nd house for Saturday (I had told Jimmy I'd need 4 full days - two for each house). He did not come out to give the men direction for house #2 on Saturday or give me the price of things the groupon didn't cover  (I had high ceilings in both houses and needed an extra room done, wall paper removed from one small wall, etc.)  \n\nHe finally came out Monday around Noon to quote prices on #2 (again reasonable) but his men were upset that he hadn't shown up either morning to give them direction.  Plus the men had some conflicts with my handyman.  The men disappeared Mon around 12:30 - they got back at 2:30ish and left by 3:30 with the RR undone and wallpaper stuck on the tub and counters (from the removal) of my bathroom. The baseboards were done poorly, paint dripping was all over the tub, counters and floors and 2nd coat was never completed.  \n\nJimmy told me that he'd come finish the job - said I was getting the \"best of the best.\"  Because I wanted a slight color alteration (lighter) in the RR, he told me there would be a charge and a small charge for one other wall.  Once the paint had dried, I realized that Jimmy had not cut in the new color or cleaned up the wall paper and paint drippings from his men. He also didn't redo the messy baseboards.  My handymen and I were shocked by Jimmy's paint job (drips, no cutting in, unfinished baseboards). Then Jimmy called and asked me to have my handymen bring him his forgotten ladder??? What?\n\nBotton line... Groupons appear to be LAST priority for timing and you'll be paying weeks before you get the work.  They may also send you new, untested employees (my two workers told me I was their first project with Jimmy).","date":"2015-08-19 05:17:03"}

Our server was friendly and helpful, but he did not bring out the dishes in the order we requested.\n\nSome dishes were what you might call \"just fine\":  The chopped salad, the blue corn pancake, and the double-baked potato.  The goat cheese queso fundido was better than \"just fine.\"  The chile relleno and the tiger shrimp were both spectacularly good - snapping with unique flavors.  The smoked chicken quesadilla, on the other hand, was sub-par and not very flavorful.\n\nSo, Mesa is a perfectly acceptable restaurant.

A partially baked cookie covered with vanilla ice cream. Drool... The entire table can share it and it's a whopping $5. Get 1 per 4 people and you're set.\n\nThere's a lounge downstairs, amazing beer selection, and much more I could talk about. Check it out. You won't be upset.","date":"2016-05-31 02:34:30"}

Extremely light but well seasoned batter encasing bite sized little curds of heaven with their home made dipping sauce was well executed. The fried smelt was a pleasant treat.

Their burger was simple yet bursting with tons of flavors that elevated the humble american staple. \nThe service was good and I'd say it was a pleasant experience dining here.

We had the gyro plate which was unlike American gyros with pita, but instead was served with a fresh Greek salad and lemon potatoes. We also got the lamb dinner special which literally fell off the bone because it was so tender. And we also got a sort of Greek lasagna with a rich white bechamel sauce. The service was super friendly and very attentive.

Their outdoor patio is delightful on warm summer evenings, and the inside, while dimly lit and a bit hipster-y, nevertheless feels welcoming and cozy. The menu is written with a heavy dose of sass and snark, which makes it a fun read. Who wants to order boring old chicken tenders when you can order \"Britney Spears\"? I should probably look into hiring their menu writer to help me jazz up my tech reports for work.\n\nAnyway, I've ordered many things here, and their food is usually solid. My favorite meal begins with a plate of their \"church basement pierogies.\" They cook up a legit pierogie, with a soft, tender shell browned to perfection and housing a ton of delicious, fluffy, flavorful potato and cheese filling. They are *almost* as good as actual church basement pierogies. Then I like to wash down my pierogies with an order of their mac and cheese topped with blackened chicken. Their mac is addictive -- creamy, rich, cheesy and topped with crunchy breadcrumbs. I really like the blackened chicken paired with the mac, as the spicy cajun seasoning on the chicken cuts through the fattiness of the cheese sauce quite nicely. Supremely delicious. I will admit that once in a blue moon the mac and cheese will be a bit dry, which is a bummer. So the consistency is not 100% there. But nine times out of ten, I'm graced with a good amount of cheese sauce and I'm a happy camper. And then I pass out in a carb-induced coma.\n\nThe downside here is, of course, their prices. They are pretty expensive. I recently got my standard pierogies-and-mac meal for take out after not having visited for awhile, and I had forgotten just how pricey they are (it was $25 + tip for my meal for take out).  So be prepared to have your wallet cry a little, but the mac and cheese should help cheer it up.","date":"2015-04-01 20:26:40"}

The restaurant was pretty empty,  but they stated they had other reservations.  I never saw a group of 8 come,  so. ..our table should have been available anyway.  We would have ordered many more drinks but instead we had one, two at the most.  The guy that finally decided to sit us was not very nice,  and rudely said \"come on! \" to which I responded that we weren't a bunch of cows being herd to our table. He didn't say anything.  Our server was alright,  her voice was a bit much on the ears, have you heard of voice fry? The food,  great, guacamole and queso fundido were tasty. The tacos great as expected, the mijito, though  not on the menu was well done. We came during happy hour,  but when checks came the bill didn't reflect that. The waitress seemed annoyed when we asked about it.  We are by no means a difficult or demanding group. So I am inclined to think it's an attitude issue on their part. I was  completely done with the experience when a plate load crashes on the floor. It falls from the hands of one of servers. It was literally next to us,  soooo loud,  pieces flying,  and not a word to apologize or something!? We weren't offered desert and at that point I was too bothered to stay longer.  I said bye and thank you as I walked out,  but there was no response from the staff.

Think about the best part of friend chicken, and then imagine having JUST that on a plate covered in spicy honey sauce. I die.\n\nOn to entrees: you can't go wrong with both styled of fried chicken. I always go for the Tennessee Hot because I like a little bit o' spice and the sauce is killer, but my hubs goes the Umbrian style (your regular run of the mill fried chicken) and it's equally delicious and fall-off-the-bone.\n\nLastly, and truly I'm saving the best for last, dessert: You have two options: you need to either go for the pie or go for the donut...\n\nThe pie is from Pie Snob (if you don't know about Pie Snob, look it up on Yelp RIGHT NOW, and then order an apple pie, and then thank me later).\n\nThe donut and pure caramel heaven. It's drenched (not drizzled) in the most delectable caramel sauce I've ever tasted, with just a pinch of sea salt to top it off. *drooling*\n\nOne pro tip before you come to Okra, since you're obviously making a reservation this very minute: it's a little hard to find. The sign is on 7th so you might be tempted to pull into the parking lot where it is, but you have to turn down Palo Verde (small side street) to get to it - it'll be on your left.","date":"2016-06-22 20:42:59"}

And they took off my first glass of wine which just shows how awesome the service is.\n\nThe skirt steak I ordered was wonderful and I was almost tearful when it was gone; the side of scalloped potatoes were equally amazing.  It almost tasted like there was a hint of truffle oil.\n\nI think that they were supposed to give me some complimentary fries, but I never got any until I called up my friend to come and join me; and then I ate some of his.\nBut I enjoyed the meal so much I didn't mind the few mistakes.\n\nIf I had more time I would have come back!","date":"2010-07-07 20:37:20"}

It felt like I was walking into someone's home. The room was filled with local handmade items, freshly baked goods, and of course, an extensive tea room with every kind of tea you could want! All teas are blended in house, and they are working on using herbs grown in a community garden in Millvale in some blends! You can even sniff the tea that you want in little jars that are laid out. We spent more than an hour there relaxing, browsing through the many gifts, books, and other goodies, and enjoying our tea and cookies.

When I first discovered yelp I went for quantity, not quality.\n\nSo this place used to be Jack Straw's which was probably THE best music venue the the town has ever \"scene\".  Well its not that place anymore.  Its still worth visiting and has more than just a bar or restaurant vibe to it.  On nice sunny days the deck is beautiful.\n\nWe had a going away party for a friend today.  We made reservations for 30 for Sunday brunch.  Only place in town with a mimosa deal that would take a crowd like us.  You would think that they would maybe tell a couple of extra servers to come in at least for the hour or 2 we were there.  We had 2 servers for our group and they also had other tables.  They did well, but felt I pretty bad for the other tables.\n\nThe brunch menu was large, but mostly it was just slight variations on eggs and meat with some major exceptions.  It was a cheaply made paper menu, but the one thing that stood out \"the hangover\" which was a breakfast sandwich on a doughnut.  But, they don't serve it anymore, even though it was on this cheaply made menu.  I tasted many peoples dishes, they were good but over priced.  Everything was roughly $9 except for biscuits and gravy and french toast.  Although, the $2 mimosa's and $4 bloody mary's is hard to beat.\n\nAll in all, this place has a history that it doesn't live up to.  Its good, but plenty of other places to go.\n\nSide notes:Parking lot sucks, but its made up by the fact that they have SKEEBALL!!!!!!!!!!","date":"2011-02-14 00:21:55"}

Then, when the food came over (after we asked for it because it took too long) waitress was in a hurry to put down our plates that she spilled all the drinks!  Water & other drinks soaked our clothes, phone, and purse. The waitress ran off quickly to get towels & came to clean up table. Never once asked us or gave us towels to dry...other customers had to until we asked her. Mind you no apology for the spill. The manager even came over to clean up with no apology but rather cracked jokes!  Moved to a new table & she quickly drops off more drinks (on the house) & almost spilled them all on us. Thankfully the new waitress took care of us.  I mentioned our meal should be on the house, when  manager comes over to say they can do the drinks only. After all, it was only water!!  The nerve!!

It is expensive, but not more expensive than the other upscale restaurants in the Palazzo\/Venetian complex.  We also know this is Mr. Keller's \"bistro\" play, it has been much documented.  And I love French bistro food, my favorite kind on earth.  So 2 stars?  Here's why:\n\nService: At these prices you expect excellent service.  We had two tables of 8 each, next to each other, and all I can say is that the service was no better than what you would hope to receive at a Chili's.  Timing was off, smiles were rare, it took forever to deliver a glass of cranberry juice to the one person not drinking wine.  Clean-up was either too early or too late.  Just a mess.  Unacceptable at a restaurant of this rep.\n\nFood:  Yes, pommes frites are a staple of bistros, and Bouchon is known for theirs, but the volume of fries was overwhelming.  At the end of the meal we all sat looking around and laughing at the endless piles of frites that nobody could finish.  I had a flatiron steak, asked for it medium rare, it arrived well done.  I could have sent it back, but given the service I didn't want to chance it, so chewed (and chewed and chewed) it down.  Steak quality was mediocre.  Had a endive\/watercress salad that truly was nothing special.  The walnut vinaigrette did nothing to enhance the bitter endive, think it made it worse.  Ostensibly there was some Roquefort cheese in the salad, but about 4 little nibbles, added nothing to the rest of the salad - disintegrated.  I know times are tight, but this is a double digit priced salad, c'mon.  Nobody raved about their entree, in fact, I think people were expecting something special and kind of stared at what was delivered.\n\nWine:  A pretty fair list, and while not reasonably priced, I've seen more outrageous pricing elsewhere.  But it was predictable, mainly French, with a nice representation from the major regions, but nothing unique or intriguing.  Very safe list.  If this is a bistro there should be some more fun, and less pricey, bistro-y choices like Cru Bourgeois from Bordeaux, a longer list of Provencal wines, some unique choices from Cali.  I could have put this list together in my sleep, and the sommelier and wine service was pretty sleepy and sloppy as well.\n\nI've been here for breakfast\/brunch, and I guess this is their speciality, it was super, a 4 or maybe 5 star breakfast, love that.  But for dinner?  A disappointment.  This restaurant needs an overhaul.","date":"2009-05-21 14:42:13"}

First, let me give you some context:\n\n1. This is not the place to come for authentic Chinese cuisine. Abort mission if that's your goal. Go somewhere with a name that you can barely understand.\n\n2. This is not the place to come for personalized service and attention, especially not at 2am on a weekend. You will be treated like what you probably are - a starving drunk person just as likely to skip out on your bill as you are to vomit on their floor. \n\nSeriously - these folks put up with a lot. A LOT. Can you imagine taking care of hundreds of drunken morons every single night for the entire weekend? It'd be like babysitting 100 children with ADHD who are also carrying loaded pistols and have an undeniable urge to hump on your white tablecloths. So I chose to cut them some slack.\n\n3. I liken this to being the Denny's of Chinese food. It is greasy, unhealthy and oh-so-delicious. You love it while your eating it. You tell yourself it's the greatest meal you've ever had in your life and you want to marry it.\n\nBut in 15 minutes it's going to sit like a stone in your stomach and you will question every ounce of your judgment. If you can survive this brief period of remorse, your overall experience will come out on the positive.\n\n4. On a diet? Yeah, no. Not for you.\n\nYes, I too have been part of the raucous crowd that convenes here late at night after a night out in the Beltline. I have slithered their noodles down my throat and I have savored the juices of their finest ginger beef. I literally can't imagine coming here for a sit down meal at any other time.\n\nI've also come here for the lunch buffet - as take out. The place isn't quite as fun when the disco ball isn't a-glowin'. Now if you're a student, a cheapskate or a person in need of large quantities of food (as much as you can physically force into a styrofoam container) - this place is a great option come lunchtime. Just make sure you bring CASH. They get a bit ornery if you try to pay with Debit\/Credit.\n\nPro tip: Stuff as much as you can into your styrofoam container and just hold it shut, even if it won't close naturally. You might get dirty looks, but I've never been yelled at - yet. Mmmmm, 5 pounds of Calgary's finest imitation Asian cuisine. \n\nIs 4 stars probably pushing it? Yes. If I could I'd give them a 3.5. But as someone else mentioned, Calgary owes these fine folks a bit of thanks for giving us an option other than late night pizza or microwaved Alphaghetti.","date":"2011-11-30 07:11:58"}

(not shampooed, just the seated sprayed off and wiped) We were told to get the $39.00 VIP package, and it would take care of cleaning off the front and back seats. Not only did the wash on the outside look horrible, they barely wiped down the front seats, doors, and dash, they also didnt wipe anything in the back. I had to argue with the manager for almost 10 minutes about wiping down the back, that took him a whole 2 minutes to do, and it was still so half-assed that I had to do it myself once I took the car home. We paid $39 for what would have been the same wash as the $7 was.\n\nI had then taken my car in for detail since I had received a detail job certificate from a friend a couple weeks prior to this fiasco, and being there are no refunds on detail jobs, I had to take it in or lose the money. So, this past weekend, it went in. They took 5 hours to detail the car. I was expecting it to take between 3-4 like they had originally told me, but, that was just the start of the frustration. I paid to have the car detailed with a clay bar to remove swirl marks and find scratches. There are now more swirl marks on my car than when it went in, not all of the wax was removed, so I had to use my microfiber cloths to remove it myself, I specifically said that I DIDNT want any armorall or leather conditioner on my interior, and to just clay bar the outside, they didnt listen to that, so I spent 30 minutes wiping greasy armorall off my interior and leather. I told the manager that I was completely dissatisfied with the job that was done, he refused to give me any money back and said I would have to bring it back for them to do the job again. I will NOT take my car back to have more damage done for another 5 hour job. I could have purchased the stuff to do the job myself in about 2 hours of time and had it done right.\n\nPlease head this warning and DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE! terrible wash, and even worse customer service.","date":"2013-05-07 15:57:59"}

When I questioned him why my gift card did not run, he was very perturbed and snapped at me when he had to cancel and re-do the transaction. Then, I ordered the Gyro, which anywhere else would not require much description. Well, I was confused by the fact that I was asked what I wanted on my Gyro (um, the usual Gyro ingredients?!) and that Hummus costs additional (which is not ever mentioned at the register when ordering the Gyro).\n\nMaybe I've never gotten over this initial experience, but I have yet to truly enjoy Pita Pit. I think the Pitas are over-filled with meat and sauce and under-filled with vegetables. Though initially tasty, I always feel very ill after eating here... I only plan on returning when I get dragged here yet again by a co-worker trying to avoid the other two chain options on this block of East Carson.","date":"2012-11-06 04:50:15"}

One nice perk is that they have an open table that you can stand at to enjoy your pre-dinner drinks so you don't have to crowd around those sitting at the bar. I absolutely love the atmosphere at this place with the big wood-burning pizza oven behind the bar where you can watch your pizza being cooked. They have a great selection of wines from different countries and their food options are not overwhelming, but always deliver big. When I went a couple months ago, they had caramelized brussel sprouts that they cooked in the wood-burning oven that were amazing!! I've tried many of their pizzas and haven't had one that I dislike. My favorites are the Quattro Formaggio and the Spicy Sopressata, which despite the name, is not too spicy. In the summer, a huge perk to this place is their outdoor patio. They have a couple long picnic tables and also have smaller tables along the fence. On a warm spring\/summer night, it's very relaxing to sit outside and enjoy the nice weather.","date":"2014-01-17 16:49:06"}

Check in was reasonable and the staff are friendly. At first I was taken back by the mandatory valet, but I like that it's based on gratuity\/tip. I love that it's smoke free and still basically on the strip. The one bedroom suite is super spacious and could honestly comfortably fit four adults if tight on cash. Rom service provides good portions for the money and is prompt. So the markdowns come for the cleaning and the gym. There were two obvious strains on the curtains, which I know if I can see, housekeeping should be able to and thus CLEAN! Also, I was curious as to why there were a pair of men's dress shoes under the bed. Did housekeeping vacuum under the bed??? Clean with their eyes closed?? I dunno. Also, my friend went to get extra pillows from the closet and said there was hair on them and they were dirty...not acceptable. Lastly, I do workout everywhere and was slightly disappointed from the size of the gym. I was still able to get a mini workout in, but I guess I was expecting more variety and no kids.

If this sort of unabashed adulation makes you uncomfortable, you might want to turn away now. You have been warned. \n\nI HAVE NEVER HAD A BETTER BRUNCH EXPERIENCE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!  The White Brick Kitchen really knows what they're doing and I don't have even one solitary complaint (and, believe me, I'm very picky and thoroughly enjoy complaining when it's warranted - so I would if I could, but I honestly can't).  Allow me to regale you all with the delicious tale of my delightful brunch. \n\nMy friend and I were fearful that we would have to wait for a table when we arrived at 10 am on a Sunday.  It was such a pleasant surprise when we were seated immediately and quickly presented with both coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very welcoming, laid-back and cozy.  I already felt very content as I sipped my OJ, little did I know that I was about to be sky rocketed from content to off-the-charts-euphoric.  It seemed as though we had only just placed our orders for the Scotch-ish Eggs when they were set before us, as if by magic. The service was so fast that it verged on ridiculous, but the quality of the food did not suffer in the least.  On paper, the Scotch-ish Eggs sound super tasty (two panko fried soft boiled eggs, hollandaise, greens, buttered baguette and potatoes), but nothing can fully prepare you for how transcendent this dish truly is.  I am awestruck by how perfectly cooked the soft-boiled eggs were in spite of the fact that they were breaded in panko and deep fried.  I have no idea how they still manage to maintain the optimal runny yolk consistency while creating such a crispy coating on the outside of the egg; it's nothing short of incredible.  Every component of the meal was outstanding - from the dressing with a subtle hint of Parmesan on the salad to the golden brown potatoes.  I can't say enough good things about this dish, you really have to try it!\n\nI'm excited to return to The White Brick Kitchen soon to try their other dishes (if they're anything like the Scotch-ish Eggs, I am definitely in for a treat).  I loved that even though they're offering high-quality food, the prices are very reasonable.  Great spot, great staff and sublime food. You really cannot ask for more!","date":"2013-01-02 18:17:53"}

It was good.  Next out were the onion rings -- about 8-10 rings of various sizes, and Ranch dressing as a dipping sauce.   The onion rings were pretty greasy, as I suppose most are, so I'm not complaining, however I do expect a big stomach-ache from them at any moment -- hopefully I'll be home by then!   I do wish more places would get rid of (more of) the grease before serving onion rings, or set them down atop a diaper or something! \n\nThe pasta course was good.  Instead of them bringing Parmesan cheese on the side, the entree came with it already atop the pasta -- fine for me, but beware, if you don't want cheese.   Also included with the pasta entree were two fresh garlic bread sticks -- they were very handy in absorbing the excess liquid in the bowl of pasta.\n\nI was sad but not surprised to see that instead of deducting a dollar or two off the price of Meatballs & Spaghetti ($8.99) since I asked for pasta & sauce without the meatballs, I was charged full price.\n\nMy bottom line:  Decent food at an OK price & good, friendly service, but neither the casino (I don't gamble) nor the restaurant will be a 'destination' for me -- I came here because I was curious, my curiosity is now satisfied, and I don't see a reason to return.

As in, it is hell. Pure hell.\n\nBelieve you me, I love a good shopping mall as much as the next gal, but I avoid the Eaton Centre like the plague. Oh Eaton Centre, how do I hate thee? Let me count the ways:\n\n1) Teeming with truant teenagers and tired tourists, travelling through the mall itself is a true testament to tenacity. The layout of the centre is confusing, and combined with the constant crowds, navigation can be complicated and challenging (cue applause). \n\n2) It is said that \"variety is the spice of life.\" Consider that the Eaton Centre has 3 Aldos, 2 Bell Worlds, 2 Feet Firsts, 2 Nutrition Houses, and 2 Sunglass Huts, to name a few. Is this really necessary? Is it a secret ploy by the city of Toronto to encourage everyone to be getting proper nutrition while rocking fabulous footwear, sporting sunglasses and chatting on a cell phone? \n\n3) The one redeeming quality of the Eaton Centre - the prime, central location - is also, in several ways, its downfall. Parking is expensive. Hordes of people travelling to and from Dundas and Queen stations and the PATH converge here. Trying to hunt for deals isn't easy when battling major pedestrian traffic.  \n\n4) The washrooms - if you can find one, that is - are always in high demand. High demand washrooms equate to dutty, dutty washrooms.\n\nFor decent mall shopping, Yorkdale is just a hop and a skip away by subway, and is far less congested with pretty much the same (if not better) selection of stores.","date":"2011-05-27 21:08:20"}

I have been on the hunt for the perfect shade of cool ash - trying to shy away from red tones as much as possible. But no matter what salon I visited (mainly in the Durham Region), the colour always ended up having a brassy tinge to it. I set out to find someone who could dye my hair exactly like I wanted. My office recently relocated to King St. E, and I looked for a salon within walking distance - finally landing on McManus and Campbell in the Distillery district. I booked an appointment with Sharon McManus (one of the owners). She listened to my concerns and helped me pick a cool ash tone out of a book of samples. My hair looks amazing, and I can finally say that I am truly happy with the result!\n\nAnd as an added bonus...THEY HAVE A SALON DOG. A sweet black lab named Rita who they rescued from Mexico I believe. She is a sweetheart who roams around the salon looking to be petted and will occasionally sit on your feet as you're getting your hair washed. The prices are also very fair... I have long, thick hair and after tax my full head of colour comes to $90.  \n\nDefinitely worth a visit!","date":"2017-03-27 12:35:46"}

We got an original, crab, and pineapple habanero as our choices.  Original was just regular old plain guac.  I wouldn't get that again.  Not with so many different choices to choose from.  Next, the crab didn't do it for me.  My wife liked it, though.  So if you don't like seafood in your guac like me skip the seafood options.  My favorite was the pinapple habanero.  Simply outstanding.  Next time I may opt for just 1 guac and some salsas.\n\nMy wife ordered the pork carnitas and I had the hanger steak.  Both meals were completely cooked to perfection and was more than enough food for dinner.  Heck, the guac was more than enough.\n\nI ordered coffee and jalapeno bread pudding for dessert.  Coffee made with cinnamon and brown sugar?  Was amazing.  The bread pudding had the jalapeno taste without the bite.  Was also to do for.  I highly recommend it.\n\nThey tell you when you make the reservation that your experience will last about 2 hours.  That was spot on.  We didn't feel rushed.  Nor did we feel it was too slow.

However, the managers(a man and a woman) are terrible. I deeply felt I was treated unfair and discriminated either because of my race, or because the purpose of my visit was to fix the glasses's problems.\n\nInstead of fixing the problem of the eye glasses they provided, the male manager would prefer to spend time on getting new customers. I went to Lenscrafters to fix a problem of my new glasses and unfortunately it was a busy day for them. He said to me that he would recommend me to come another day because they were busy. Before and after he said this to me, he didn't say the same words to all other customers who needed to get a new glasses or to pick up a glasses. He quickly assigned them (many people came after me) to specialists' tables and let me wait at the shopping area for 30 minutes. Was that because I was Asian, or because he didn't taking my request(fixing the problem of the glasses) seriously? Both.\n\nWhat the female manager only cared about was getting you out of there as quick as she can and getting more customers. The third time I went there to pick up an adjusted glasses, the female manager assigned me to a specialist's table. I had been waiting for 20mins at the table, which I thought it was totally ok because they were busy. However, when a specialist finally came to me and started to help me to adjust my glasses, the female manager came to talk to the specialist right away and said \"after you get this done, I want you to go to another table.\" She pointed at the table where two white female customers JUST CAME 1 minute ago. That specialist hadn't even started helping me yet and I could sense that he felt awkward, too. He was nice and tried his best to adjust my glasses. During this time, the female manager came twice to our table to rush him go to another table to serve the white ladies. I ignored her and kept talking with the specialist about my glasses. I needed to get my glasses adjusted right since that was the second time to fix this problem. The female manager kept standing 1 meter away from our table and starring at us the whole time. I guess to this female manager, white customers were more important, their time was more valuable and they should not be waiting for a \"long\" time. Therefore she believed that she could rudely and frequently interrupt the service I was receiving and ask the specialist who was helping me to quickly get my part done and to run to help the white customers. If this wasn't her logic, I didn't know what her logic was.\n\nI wouldn't go to Lenscrafters again. Terrible experience.","date":"2018-04-27 23:33:29"}

This Historic land mark used to be know as the Cleveland Union Terminal and signs of its history are everywhere. \n\nThis unique center is connected to two hotels (Ritz Carlton & Renaissance) a huge casino (Horseshoe), an 11-screen movie theater, 100 shops, 6 restaurants, and  Cleveland's mass transit system. (RTA). They also have connected walkways to Progressive Field, and Quicken Loans Arena.\n\nThe Skylight Concourse is definitely something to see; this four story (+) tall atrium overlooks the Cuyahoga river hosting a food court and cinema. Here you can grab some stir-fried veggies at Sakkio Japan, Bourbon Chicken at Kelly's Cajun Grill, or just a warm pretzel from Auntie Anne's while enjoying the scenery of  downtown Cleveland and Ohio City.\n\nThe holidays at Cleveland City Center is truly a sight to see. In December they have a 40ft tall Christmas tree with larger than life hanging mechanical ornaments, Gingerbread village, and the best thing ever, the Twigbee Shop! Here you can bring kids under 12 with their shopping list for parents, grandparents, siblings, aunts, and uncles and a volunteer helps the little ones buy gifts under $10 that are pre-wrapped. \n\nBesides all the cool shops, you can truly just get lost in this place and enjoy the sights and sounds. Eat, drink, shop, eat, drink, shop... How can you go wrong with that. If all else fails, go blow your shopping money at the casino.\n\nOne of my favorite amenities at City Center is the subway. Cleveland's RTA rumbles below the center giving you the feel a bustling metropolis. Here you can jump the sub and go pretty much anywhere you want in the city, and the mall resembles an oldtyme train station. Just the architecture alone draws me in, I can spend an entire day meandering the halls, people watching, sipping coffee and munching on some delicious treats.\n\nTower City Center is a safe, clean, and fun place to take the kids, watch a movie, or blow your paycheck, just remember to get your parking ticket validated.","date":"2013-10-03 13:18:24"}

It wasn't obtrusive to our meal, just comical. \n\nEven without the All You Can Eat, the prices were incredibly reasonable. It's not much for ambiance, but it looked beautiful and tasted great!","date":"2017-08-28 21:04:07"}

When our meals came they were cold. My hashbrowns tasted like they just chopped up a raw potato and put it on a plate. Our waitress never came back to see how the food was and just brought the check\n When we went to the cashier she was too busy talking it up with a coworker to help us.

We sat outside on a beautiful fall evening, with the sights and sounds of Cleveland's Flats gradually coming back to life. It's a great menu, with lots to choose from. We had the calamari (sauteed, not fried, in a delicious tomato sauce that was perfect for dipping lots of bread in) and the homemade pasta with meatballs. It's the best of comfort food, with enough imagination and elegance to make it special. I had a delicious easy glass of pinot noir and my boyfriend had a gin martini -- we agreed it was exactly how we like our martinis: extremely cold, with just the right balance, and awesome cheese stuffed olives. Our only disappointment was the mushroom pizza--the crust is nothing special and the toppings were just ok. We were so happy (and full) at that point, the so-so pizza didn't faze us at all. We'll just stick to ordering pizza at Humble in Lakewood, and come back to Lago for the pasta. A great evening all around!","date":"2014-09-25 12:49:26"}

My most recent experience was unplanned as my car was totaled in a rear end collision. The first thing Adora did when she heard was offer any assistance she could that was NON sales related. She was genuinely concerned for my well being as a friend which was highly appreciated. She knows her product and does the best job of getting to know you, the customer. There is never a sales pitch. She's honest and thorough and will work her tail off to get you the best price possible. Trust me as I have never been one to pay a penny more than I have to. Patience, integrity, and incredibly thorough answering any and all questions. Excellent follow up after the purchase.","date":"2016-12-19 19:13:59"}

We arrived in town early on a Sunday, checked in (surprisingly short line!), but rooms were not ready yet as they had had a busy weekend. No problem, we checked our luggage and went to get something to eat. We checked back in at the desk and were given our rooms (we always upgrade to GO Rooms), and shortly after that our luggage was brought up to us! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our rooms were very nice, cleaned daily and always while we were out. I loved our view, best we've ever had in countless trips to Vegas. The bed was very comfy. We even had a fridge in our room! There are plenty of elevators in this hotel and you can use different ones to get quicker access to different parts of the hotel\/casino. We loved meeting for breakfast on the patio in the gardens where we would sit with a muffin and coffee and plan our day. The pool was nice too. We did not get a car due to traveling with a group this time so it was nice to be so centrally located with access to everything we wanted to do. We tried the new Carlos N Charlies' restaurant and it was good. We also like the food court, very handy with plenty of options. Our only complaint was with the restaurant, while the food & service were pretty good the problem was when it was time to leave we had to wait in a long line to pay our bill! They could have used a few more staff people to expedite this process.","date":"2012-10-08 19:08:16"}

Just because I feel generous. \n\nService: okay. When we walked in, a guy behind the counter just stared blankly at us and asked if it was dine-in and handed us menus and told us to sit where ever, so ok cool. It took about 10 minutes before the same guy came to us to approach us and ask for drink orders, and by this time, 2 other tables have sat. He was the only apparent server so I was trying to cut him slack (I work in the restaurant biz), but if you were the one who handed us menus and serve us...10 minutes is a stretch. He let my drink go empty twice, but partially my fault--I was thirsty. Didn't really come by and check if we needed anything, we eventually got what we needed ourselves by reaching onto the server's counter (sorry). There were about 5 tables in there around the time we went (6pm-6:30pm), so it wasn't that busy...service could've been better in my opinion. \n\nFood and Pricing: I ordered a medium bowl of pho dac biet, probably the most common pho in any pho restaurant. The portion was SMALLER than most pho restaurants I've been to, and more expensive than the other pho restaurants I've been to. It was about 10$ for a medium, and in my opinion, was NOT worth it. The broth is more on the bland side, so season well with the condiments. Probably about 6 pieces of meat in there max, so if you like a large portion of meat in your pho, don't eat here. I also ordered an order of spring rolls. They were eh, okay. They're small also compared to other restaurants, and of course, cost a little bit more than other restaurants. \n\nOverall: It was a whim coming in here, I probably won't be back because I live in Charlotte and was just in the area. If I was from the area, I'd probably try somewhere else also. The portion of the food just didn't match the price, you can find better pho elsewhere. Even if that means driving a little further. The service wasn't spectacular either to make up for the food. Pretty much to sum it up, mediocre. I'd recommend eating elsewhere!","date":"2016-12-19 08:04:45"}

I ordered the Chick'n Pot Pie with a market salad on a side, and a Banana Chocolate Chip Sour Cream Cake. Overall, I was pleased with my order. This is a restaurant I'd try again. I gave 4\/5 stars for the great pot pie. I wish the price was cheaper though but it's understandable since most vegan restaurants have this price point. See details on the food below!\n\nChick'n Pot Pie = 4\/5 \nI really enjoyed this one. When it arrived, it was a bit warm, which is expected since it was delivery. I bet if I had this in the restaurant it would have been hot, comforting, and perfect. It had potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots, red bell pepper, beans, peas, and a nice crust. I wish it had more chick'n though. The salad had spinach, shredded beets, red bell pepper, tomatoes, cucumbers, and balsamic vinaigrette. It was definitely filling and I'd order it again.\n\nBanana Chocolate Chip Sour Cream Cake = 2.5\/5\nThis was a fancier banana bread. The size reminds me of those school safe banana bread snacks you can get from Costco. It basically tastes like that - sweet. I was disappointed with this one since I found it pricey for what reminded me of a school snack. I thought it would be a slice of cake, but it looks just like that snack. I wouldn't repurchase this again. Definitely try a different dessert.","date":"2017-06-06 18:52:11"}

He had us wait outside, which was absolutely ridiculous when he could've simply opened the door to let us sit in there and wait for him to check us in. Not only was it already HOT, but now we also had major hot air blowing at us from under his bus! He checked us on the bus one by one, again, taking his precious time!

The facility itself is very professional, simple and well decorated.  The rooms are very calming, clean and quiet.  The therapists themselves are very varied in their techniques and skill levels.  I have tried 5 different therapists before finally finding one who is AMAZING.  The first therapist I had was TERRIBLE and I felt like i wasted my money.  The good thing about this facility is that there are many therapists on staff so if you don't like one you then you can try another.  The other therapists were good for first timers or clients looking for a non-aggressive relaxing massage.  I enjoy high pressure deep tissue massages and I finally found an amazing therapist who I exclusively book appointments with.\n\nI had a couple of negative experiences where I got 2 eye stys immediately after my massage.  I noticed on both occasions that there was residue black eye makeup on the face towel where I lay my head.  I don't know if the face towel was reused but I also understand that mascara and eyeliner don't wash out of white towels so I just assumed that the towels were fresh at the time.  I also did not request to have them changed because I didn't want to be rude so that was my mistake and I can't prove that the towels were reused so I won't fault them for that.  \n\nIn summary, if you have signed up for a membership then take the time to really try different therapists and find the one that is right for you. The staff are very polite and professional.  The value is great if you go for regular massages but only if you have a great therapist.","date":"2017-10-11 00:55:34"}

All the while the person is changing your oil, they pull other parts out of the car (air filter, etc) and ask that you get them replaced, even if they've been replaced somewhere else. When I told them I got the part fixed before, they asked \"where\" in an almost confronting manner, as if they never believed it was done. Some of the service was done by them only months prior, and they acted as if they couldn't find it within their computers. Shouldn't be that hard, if whenever I decline their service that they offer me besides the oil change, they remind me the next time that I declined them the last time. I argued with the last serviceman the last time I took my jeep in for a good 15 minutes about transmission flushes. \n\nStick to your guns while going here. If all you need is an oil+filter change, tell them that when you go there. Tell them that you are not interested in anything else, or that you do other maintenance measures yourself. Oil changes don't cost much, but when the salesy pitch is pulled out, you may end up spending an upwards of 300$ on something you don't really need!","date":"2015-08-19 05:20:48"}

And when I say slow I mean I aged considerably while waiting for my food. I wish I could say this only happened once, but it's happened every time I've been there.

Also, their pork and chicken chop with garlic sauce on rice qas great too. The sauce wasn't too strong. It was aromatic and delicious. \n\nBut lemme tell you about the satay chicken udon I had. Oh my goodness. So many toppings and they had strips of green and red pepper to help complicate the taste. The noodles weren't oily. You could actually taste the gusto the chef put in when he was cooking this delectable dish in his wok. Oh my gosh. Definite 5\/5.\n\nAnd then! We had free dessert! It was my fav. I have to say, this is a very unique recipe of coconut sago and I love it. This coconut sago has taro chunks and egg.

There were no lines, no drips, nothing negative about the spray at all. Plus Angie's attention to detail is what keeps spots from being darker or lighter than they should be. Just follow her instructions & you will be able to sustain the airbrush for up to 10 days. MOISTURIZE!!! & it will be so awesome. I got the booster to upgrade my base i had been working on.

My cravings were something fried, but also wanted some spicy soup to balance the two out. My thoughts were Tang Soo Yook and Jjampong!!! \n\nWe walked in a few minutes before closing and asked the server if she was still serving... she went back to the kitchen to see if the light was still on. If the light is on, that means the Chef can still cook for us and luckily it was!!!\n\nI enjoyed their Tang Soo Yook, which is a deep fried pork that comes with a tangy jelly-like sauce.. similar to sweet and sour that they give you on the side to pour over. This came out steamy, hot!!! Tasted fresh and love the tempura\/cornstarch batter that makes this deep fried pork so delightful to eat. The oil that was used seem new and made this dish taste light and perfectly crisp. Each bite was pipin' hot and delicious. The sauce that completes this dish consists of sliced cucumber, carrot, napa cabbage, wood ear mushrooms, and onion. I would say, without this sauce.. it would be very plain jane and definitely wouldn't be as good. Love!\n\nMy minus one star was the Jjampong. Although it had chunks of seafood, it lacked flavor tremendously. It was like putting chunks of cayenne pepper in water and heating it up. The spices didn't really do it for me and I felt like there were some missing ingredients that could have done wonders for this soup. That was the only thing that wasn't so great, but I did enjoy the texture of the noodles in this soup very much. \n\nTheir side dishes is very limited to only daikon and kimchi. But their kimchi is very notable... my Father loves the kimchi here and so do I. Small bite size square cut shaped, lightly seasoned, crisp, with a solid homemade taste. If they sold this by the jar, I would definitely buy a few :) Delicious.\n\nThis restaurant is also very known for their Jjajangmyun. A thick black soybean paste sauce with diced meat (pork) and vegetables (mainly diced onion). Normally, if you ask for Jjajangmyun, the sauce is already pre-made, but you can ask the server to cook the sauce fresh, which is called Gan Jjajang myun. If you like your vegetables cooked well, then order Jjajangmyun. If you like your vegetables semi-raw, then you will enjoy Gan Jjajang myun. I enjoy mine cooked well and so does my Mother. My Father, on the other hand orders the semi-raw. I don't think anybody knows that they can order it this way, so just sharing how my Family and I order our food choices here.\n\nThe location is somewhat hidden.. it's tucked in a corner nearby 168 market.. in between the Furniture Store and Nelson Barber Shop. Even the name of this restaurant is written in Chinese Characters, so don't look for Shan Dong!! Good service, great meal, and satisfies my cravings for Korean-Chinese cuisine.","date":"2012-04-28 09:57:50"}

Not only are these burger massive but they taste amazing also.  Its massive and super messy and super hard to eat.  A good burger is a messy burger.  Well that's what I say at least.  I have visited C & Dubbs many times but my last visit i realized I had never reviewed it.

Long story short, we finally make it into the buffet area and were seated.  We had to wait about 10 minutes before we were even brought water. We finally got to the food only to find that it was not great. The fish was very dry. In all honesty the two things I really only enjoyed were the gumbo soup and cocktail shrimp. For the price of the buffet here and income of a casino I was expecting much higher quality food. We were also barely acknowledged by our waiter, and some of the other waiters were yelling slang to each other in the dining area. Very unprofessional. To top off our \"not so good experience\" we were told that we could not be refunded the $35.00 parking fee. But wait..

Absolutely love the dinner. We've been wanting to go for brunch and finally did. Here's my comparison of the two:\n\nBrunch bread basket was better... which says a lot cuz I'm a sucker for the jalapeño cheese bread at dinner. But there's like some coffee cakes and oatmeal things and mini jalapeño muffins that were all delicious. \n\nIf you go for dinner you HAVE to get the cactus pear margarita on the rocks. By far the best margaritas we've tried to this day. Also their side of corn is amazing but seasonal. The tiger shrimp appetizer and rough cut tuna nachos are go tos for us as well. \n\nAs far as breakfast goes, we got both quesadillas (one with egg and one with salmons- i forget what they were called) and they were delicious. The sweet potato clam soup is also great, we've had it twice. It was better the first time but still very good. My waffles... AMAZING. I could have eaten a whole stack! My husbands potato hash Benedict wasn't as spectacular. The flavor was fine but it was all one note texture wise. Very mushy. The mango glazed bacon was good- take it or leave it. \n\nOverall we are fans on Mesa and always come back. Usually we get a couple things we know we love and always try something new as well! Our service has always been excellent.","date":"2018-07-07 23:19:26"}

I didnt know what to expect especially from a place called I Love Sushi, let alone it being located in a strip mall. Boy we're we surprised. This place was huge and had about 20 sushi chefs working behind the counter. The place was packed on a Tuesday night. I think the place seats about 200 easily. Wow. The food was awesome. AWESOME. The rolls were about $12-15 each but boy were they worth it. I guess one of the gimmicks of this place is the names of the rolls. Screaming Orgasm, Taste Like My Ex Girlfriend, Fat A$$ Special, and so forth. Regardless about the name, the flavor was top top notch. This is definitely one of my favorite places to eat at. Even though the names and description mention \"special chef sauce\", they are all different sauces that are highly recommended by the sushi chefs. I read somewhere there was a total of 81 chefs that are employed there. Here's a list of rolls we had:\n\n(Check out the pictures I added to the I Love Sushi page. Warning: May cause a craving for some Sushi!)\n\nJackpot Roll - I dont remember the exact description but its a fried tempura roll with spicy mayo sauce.\nSpider Roll - Soft Shell Crab\nScreaming Orgasm - Seared Tuna in chef special sauce\nFat Ass Roll - Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, white tuna, crab meat, avocado, deep fried panko, spicy mayo, hot sauce & eel sauce.\nI Love Sushi Special - Spicy tuna & cucumber topped with tuna & spicy special sauce\nDouble D roll - Raw Salmon and tuna on a roll and then into the yummy sauce\nDragon Roll - Lotsa lotsa Unagi.\nBaked Scallop Mushroom","date":"2008-08-19 05:13:44"}

That being said, their \"best brunch in town\" claims may not be that far from the truth.\n\nI ordered the stuffed French toast, which featured two LARGE slices of sourdough bread, stuffed with mascarpone cheese, and topped with enough maple syrup, fresh strawberries, and whipped cream to put me into a sugar coma for the rest of the day.  Coming with a side of bacon, I couldn't ask for anything more.\n\nTheir brunch menu isn't extensive, but what they lack in options they make up for with pure quality, both in the ingredients they use and portion sizes they present.

I would say that the firecracker shrimp, garlic noodles, selection of fresh spring rolls, and shaken beef deserve a 4 but pho is maybe a 3 and their crispy spring rolls is probably a 2. \n\nSpring rolls: They have a great selection of some traditional and some really Americanized spring rolls, but nevertheless, their spring rolls are great. My grandmothers and Vietnamese restaurant-owning relatives probably wouldn't recognize half of the spring rolls they sell here, but they're tasty. My favorites? The Spicy Asian (Chinese sausage, imitation crab, sriracha, jalapeno, some sort of crunchy stick) and the Enlighten me (this one's vegetarian). \n\nPho: Average.

To keep this short we were lied to about personal training contracts which set off a cascade of events.  We had personal training for a year with LA.  When that expired we went to cancel our training and were told, at the time of signing, that we could use any banked sessions after canceling.  The personal training manager at the gym on Riverview (Peter) told us this was not the case and to prevent our 16 banked sessions from expiring 30 days later we could change our contract to one session per month.  We did.  After that we could never get in with our trainer.  We would show up to discover that he was working with someone else, we would schedule times with him and then they would mysteriously fall off the schedule, and we even noticed that we were being charged for sessions with other trainers that we didn't book.  We believe that Peter was filling our trainer's schedule with new clients and pushing us off since we were on our way out. When talking to Peter he was sure to inform us of his salary and that to keep his position he needs to keep his body fat under a certain percentage.\n\nI spoke with James T. (VP of Personal Training) and we worked out a deal.  We were refunded some of the sessions we had banked and could keep the balance without them expiring.  We had to take a few months off of lifting due to an injury so this was a great arrangement.\n\nWhen we went to use the sessions we were told they had expired.  I contacted James to get them back.  After four weeks and five voice messages James never called me back.  I emailed the customer service email and they eventually called me.  They only gave me 3 sessions back.  I told them this was unacceptable as we should have had 4 and that I would not allow them to just steal the session.  I then received a call from the Regional Operations Manager for Phoenix.  He agreed to refund us for the one session that was still in dispute.\n\nWe went to the gym on Stapley\/University to use our three sessions.  We were very specific about what we wanted.  All we needed at this time was help to perfect squat and deadlift form.  We were told that Joseph is the guy for that.  We scheduled a time to work with Joseph.  We showed up as scheduled and the front desk informed us that he doesn't work at that time.  We checked the schedule in the app to find out that somebody moved our appointment with Joseph from a saturday to a thursday without contacting us.  We then rescheduled a time with Joseph.\n\nWhen we met Joseph for our session he very arrogently and aggressively scolded me for asking him to only help us with form. \"That's not how training works, if you're going to work out with me I'm going to make your plan and you're going to do what I say.\"  We spoke with the manager and he told me we could either work out with Joseph or not, but that we would be charged for the session.  We were very specific when we scheduled the session that we did not want him to make a plan and that all we needed was help with our form.  \n\nI chose not to challenge this because I was tired of having to speak with people in upper management to resolve issues caused in the gym and this was the third strike for LA Fitness.  We were charged the session and we will simply allow the last two sessions to go unused rather than giving LA another opportunity to disappoint us.  We have canceled our membership and will work out at a different gym moving forward.\n\nThroughout our time at LA Fitness we have been treated as a bank for which to remove money.  The service has been terrible, we have been continually lied to, being scolded and talked down to by a person whom I paid $100 per hour to work out with was the last straw.  I will not miss LA Fitness.  \n\nMy best recommendation is to avoid LA Fitness.","date":"2018-03-15 19:27:11"}

The servers are really nice and really cute :o. Lol. Anyway, we wanted to get a hachapuri and some khinkali (georgian dumplings). There were no pictures on the menu, but even the photos on yelp were hard to distinguish the sizing and portion of food. Let me say upon arrival of our food I was shocked by how generous the portions were! The Khinkali dumplings each of them were like the size of a small person's fist. And the hachapuri was the size of a small pizza. Very filling indeed, even when sharing with a friend. We both loved the food. The khinkali pork and beef had some interesting spices...tasted very beefy and rich. I needed to cleanse the palate with some of their tangy dipping sauces from time to time. Their sauces are really tasty btw. They come as a complimentary appetizer with some hot buns on the side.\n\nThe food was so memorable! I would love to come back to try some other Georgian dishes.

If it hadn't been for Macon and her partner in crime, Alex Woodford, it may not have happened.  Those two were so awesome, patient and understanding about how I needed time to review the information and consider everything before making the final decision.

None of the techs even appeared close to being done with their current clients, and no one had ever told me they'd be with me soon. I decided to leave and as I gathered my things, a tech asked me if I was leaving. She told me she was going to do a manicure, then me next. I told her I couldn't wait that long, that my water was cold, I'd been sitting there a half hour. I told her it's ok to say they don't have time, or just have me wait up front, but they shouldn't have sat me in a pedi station with my feet in water waiting for that long. I won't be back.","date":"2018-08-04 20:55:43"}

This is why I haven't trusted a Dental office in so many years, but with Cheyenne Dental Group I found one I can really trust.\n\nSetting up an appointment is easy but finding an open spot to be seen is hard, so get your appointments in.  For example and most recently I called Wednesday night close to closing to be seen for a quick checkup and the next available was on Tuesday at 3pm(!) ugh, with Monday being a holiday.  But with great service comes great demand.\n\nI then met Dr. Tounian whom assessed and had recommendations on work that needed to be done.  No pressure at all on what I needed and wanted.  My insurance isn't the best but they worked with me on getting the necessary work done as well.  \n\nNow lets talk about the treatment.  The assistants and staff were nice but my duel was against Dr. Lisa Hoang (spelling?) and faith was put into her hands.

Not only do you get to shoot more guns at this venue it seems, but it also seems more suited to novices as well. They provide you with transportation to and from the strip. The driver was nice and very conversational. \n\nOnce we got to the gun garage all we had to do was fill out a form, show our IDs, and listen to our gun range officer and we were ready to go. Our range safety officer's name was James and he was extremely friendly and polite. He knew both of us had never shot a gun before and so he made sure he went over all of the proper steps with us more than once. Not once throughout our entire time there did we feel intimidated. He even gave us support while we were firing because we had never felt recoil before. \n\nIn all we got to shoot A LOT of guns (9 I believe), much more than with the similarly priced deals at Battlefield Vegas. Although the whole experience only lasts about 15-20 minutes per person it felt like a really long time probably because it was our first time shooting and because of all of the adrenaline pumping. I definitely want to go back and shoot my favorite guns with more clips since I now know which ones I like.

If you look up \"host\" in the dictionary, Jarod's picture should be displayed. He was bombarded every minute from our arrival to when we were eventually seated. He was calm, collected and extremely pleasant. The best part, when he came to fetch us at Central Wine he said, \"Your table is ready. Don't rush. You waited for us. We will wait for you.\" *Phenomenal* \n\n2) Courteous Wait Staff: at no point did we receive any attitude to our hungry and impatient (did I mention over-heated?) dispositions. Instead, we were comped and sweetened with desert and smiles.\n\nThe 2 hour wait to be served a semblance of food & beverage from check-in to seating is absurd. We arrived at 7:20 and were told a couple tables had bills and should be cleared \"shortly\". A stuffy 30 min later we informed our patient host that we would be at Central Wine (a fantastically COOL waiting area). Once we were seated (around 8:20) we were greeted, a beverage and app order taken - both were served together about 12 min later. Thank goodness we had water refilled. Seriously, it had to be 81 degrees in the dining room. We ordered our entrees right away.\n\nI have to say the \"special\" was quite tasty: salmon sashimi, seaweed, carrots, mandarin oranges and I believe some small grapefruit over brown rice. There was no way I was going to handle a steaming plate\/bowl of anything in that heat. My husband was disappointed at the amount of duck in his Massaman Curry. The noodles far outweighed the 5, possibly 6, thinly sliced pieces of duck. And he was generous to share a piece with me, but once I saw how little he had I felt bad and offered it back. I tasted a bit and it tantalized the tastebuds but left much to desire ... more duck!\n\nPerhaps Friday night is not the time to dine at Clever Koi. I would like to give it another chance, as this kind of pleasant service is hard to find anymore. I think I'll wait until October or November to tantalize my longing for their Spicy Seafood Hot Pot.

Strange, I know, but let me explain.\n\nI made an appointment on a Monday for this location (which is a good 30 minutes away) for the following Friday. Even though I was not sure it was going to be open (Friday was the day before a holiday), they told me they were and confirmed my appointment. \n\nThat Friday I drove to the location and waited for the doors to unlock so I could take care of my bothersome cavity. \n\nI waited. And waited. And waited. Yes, you get the point.\n\nBig surprise, they weren't open. Nobody had given me the courtesy to call, apologize for the scheduling mistake and reschedule. So instead of booking another dentist to take care of my increasingly painful cavity, I had to wait almost another week to get into a stellar dentist who confirms their appointments ahead of time and are very friendly.\n\nP.S. 4 days after the missed\/accidental appointment I received a call\/voicemail stating that they got my message and if I was interested in still obtaining their service I could call X phone #. No apology. I didn't expect champagne, catered breakfast and a red carpet as I walked into the office, but a simple apology for THEIR mistake would have saved my business and resulted in more referrals. \n\nSorry Absolute Dental. Fail.","date":"2011-05-27 05:22:25"}

It isn't anything fancy, wasn't busy, we were seated quickly and was less expensive compared to any other sushi restaurant I have been to in Las Vegas. \n\nI had order the spicy tuna roll which was about $12 (super spicy), the eel roll which was about $12-$13 and a glass of orange juice which was $4.

If you sit on the right side, Tomo shares an adjacent wall with a noisy night club, and your table will thump with hip-hop music. This obviously isn't their fault for having noisy neighbors, but it can definitely hinder a first date or good conversation.\n\nThis also goes for choosing when to eat there. I recommend Friday night, before the bar crowds start rolling into the neighborhood. You'll find better parking, and it will be a quieter experience. As for the food, the sushi at Tomo is quality for the prices, but be prepared to spend a little more than usual. The presentation is beautiful, and the service is fast considering their busy Warehouse District location. I absolutely love the Indian Roll and the Sexy Girl roll, and I must mention how nice it is to have a hibachi downtown. The sushi is worthy of a visit, but if you don't have time to sit down, they will never fail you on takeout.","date":"2016-03-06 23:43:57"}

Walk in and an employee will hand you a handy, dandy card which you use to swipe and accumulate expenses at various food stations (pasta, salad, antipasto, pizza, bar, dessert). It's convenient and not too crowded. Apparently the pasta is made fresh daily and they actually cook the dish in front of you--note, this significantly increases your wait time. \n\nI ordered the Pasta Vongole (one of the specials listed in front of the pasta station - $9.95). It was supposed to have white wine, clams, garlic, capers, and anchovies. However, upon closer inspection, my capers and anchovies must have vanished in thin air. The pasta is good, but the dish as a whole lacked flavor. LIke past reviewers, I also found my pasta dry (however, one of my friends had pasta that looked like it was sauced in soup). Serving sizes are huge though (considering how filling pasta can be). My friend who got the carbonara said the sauce was much too heavy but he really enjoyed his side caesar salad. \"The anchovy flavor was great.\" I also got the trio of bruschetta ($4.50) and white chocolate mousse ($2.75) to go. \n\nFinally, I had some issues with the card they provided in that it charged me almost $10 more than it should have when I went to check out. Fortunately, the cashiers were understanding and removed the mysteriously appearing dishes from my check. Overall, I would give this place a second chance since the fresh-made pasta actually has a great texture and the employees are friendly. It's also a great alternative to fast food and traditional sit-down restaurants.","date":"2012-06-26 02:43:12"}

Unfortunately, the food and service were awful.  We will not be back.  \n\nWhen we arrived at around 9:30 on a Saturday morning, the restaurant was not crowded.  Even so, the service was very slow.  There seemed to be one waiter and one busboy on duty.  The waiter seated us and then vanished.  My husband finally went over to the coffee station, brought the pot  to our table and filled our empty cups.  The coffee was fair -- not great.  We eventually saw the waiter, at the back of the room talking on his cell phone.  After a wait of nearly half an hour, we were getting up to leave.  The busboy suddenly appeared and took our order.\n\nOur meal arrived quickly.  The busboy who brought our food dropped the containers of jam onto the floor, picked them up, stacked them back in their little holder and put them onto our table.  Needless to say, we skipped the jam.  We asked repeatedly for butter for our toast & biscuit, and finally my husband headed for the kitchen to find some.  He was intercepted by the busboy, who brought butter.  By this time, our toast & biscuit were stone cold.\n\nMy veggie omelet was so greasy that I couldn't eat it.  My biscuit was obviously a pre-packaged item, which had been split and toasted on the grill in an apparent effort to make it seem fresh.\n\nMy husband's scrambled eggs and sausage were OK -- nothing special.  The bacon strips were curled up in little balls ... apparently no one in the kitchen knows how to cook bacon.  The sliced tomato was good.\n\nThe menu is enormous.  Based on our experience this morning, I would guess that most of the food is precooked, prepackaged and just heated in the microwave or otherwise warmed for service.  Icky!\n\nIf you want a delicious, fresh breakfast in Fountain Hills, our best recommendations are Sofrita on Avenue of the Fountains (great coffee, interesting fresh food, creative decor) or EuroPizza Cafe on Saguaro in Lakeside Plaza (good coffee, good fresh food, lovely view of the lake and fountain).  For bagels, try DJs on Palisades in the Safeway center.  We would suggest steering clear of Kimmie's.","date":"2013-07-13 19:19:14"}

The tenderness of the meat was perfect with being too overcooked. Getting medium-rare sab f meat had its own unique taste which complimented the seasoning really well. Each bit was like getting a massage on my palate by the juice that sprayed out. It was quite MOOving if I may say.

I waited 15 minutes, didn't see the bus, so I called and they made some excuse about the \"strip being closed\".  Seriously?  Why do I see other shuttles coming to the hotel?  The guy said the bus will be here in an hour.  I decided to take one of the other shuttles that were coming and got in their line.

We were greeted warmly and taken to the table. Interesting enough, the first thing i noticed here is the deco, very contemporary american diner setting, yeah, that's how I could describe. The dinner tables and chairs are clearly divided into two colors, beige-ish or dark chocolate-ish, somehow there were no specific color match arrangement or setting, it was a bit random to me.\n\nWhile the hostess was very nice, our waitress had a I-do-not-want-to-work-on-sundays face, I think that just described enough. My entree was the butternut squash risotto. The presentation of this dish was good at a first sight, but when you look at it closely, I don't understand why the fried almost turned black brussels leaves are floating around, it was oily and tasteless. If you want to add a touch of green to the dish, maybe don't fry it as much so it would stay at green. Overall the dish was too salty for me, and a bit too rich as well....Though my friend enjoyed his shrimp and sausage dish very much.\n\nMaybe next time...","date":"2013-11-14 05:36:39"}

This example of administrative ineptness will prevent me from seeking out Western Dental for actual business.\n\nUpdate:  Thank you to Cynthia for the reply below.  However, I do not wish to share personal information with a company I do not and have never done business with, and the phone calls I am receiving from Western Dental ask for a different person than me.  Having spent nearly 5 years with metal train-track braces until the age of 17, I have an aversion for dentists and have not seen one in 20+ years.  I also have only owned this phone number for 4 years.  Therefore, I am confident you will not find my name or birth date within your records.   Yes, I still have all my teeth and the money my parents spent every month over those long 5 years has not gone to waste.  With my repeated requests (including twice in the last two days) to remove my phone number from Western Dental records and now that I have blocked 602-258-2371 from my phone, I do not expect to receive calls from Western Dental.  If Western Dental chooses to call from a different phone number, rather than following through with removing my phone number as promised, then I will be glad to update this post again with those calls.","date":"2017-09-20 18:39:03"}

I was wary at the $7 price, but the mix of dark chocolate, cinnamon and red chili was too intriguing to pass up. It pretty much rocked my world. So I did some research and discovered that there was a shop in Vegas, and wouldn't you know.. I had a trip planned already for Spring Break! \n\nVisiting the shop was the only thing on my itinerary for that weekend, and when I finally was able to drag my bro and sis there, we were in heaven. I walked off with a bagful of bars and some toffee, plus a few gifts for friends. At least 2 flavors are available for samples on the counter, but more importantly you can sample almost everything with the assistance of the staff. After my lengthy visit, I had sampled more than half of the options I think! What a great chocolate coma I had the rest of the day.  \n\nBesides the great product, what I was really impressed with was the friendly staff. I got a lot of great information and tips from the woman who helped me, and she was more than happy to give me and my family plenty of samples and suggestions. Those of you that read my reviews know how much I appreciate great service like this. And as a little epilogue, the other day I received a letter in the mail from the shop, which contained a hand-written note thanking me for my patronage and included a coupon for store and online use.

Our first reservation choice wasn't Sunday but it was the only time we could get in. This was my first visit to Chima and my boyfriend's second visit. We arrived right at 7:30 and waited about 10 minutes before our table was ready. The restaurant was pretty easy to find and valet parking was complimentary.  We ate upstairs which I understand is less crowded than the downstairs dining area.\n\nThe restaurant was right downtown Charlotte and the decor was modern, sleek and warm. First portion of the three-course meal was the salad bar, which in my opinion is enough for a meal. I don't know if they offer that alone but it might be a good idea if they ever decide to open for lunch. It also might be appealing to those of us who can't justify spending fifty bucks there outside of restaurant week since the meal is just way too much for the average person to eat in my opinion.\n\nThe salad bar was very decadent and consisted of beef carpaccio, caprese salad, shrimp salad, a nice variety of greens, melon, soy beans, chicken salad, waldorf salad and few others items. There was also a wide variety of dressings, sauces for your meats, a couple different types of rice, three or four different soups, and bread with butter. \n\nAfter visiting the salad bar you sit down and the men come by with a variety of meats. My favorite was by far the top sirloin; second favorite was the parmesan pork tenderloin. It was pretty salty but still good. I also had the filet mignon wrapped with bacon but it was pretty fatty for a filet. I also enjoyed the flank steak and chicken. My boyfriend really enjoyed the ribs. I also had the swordfish, which I found to be a bit dry, and the lamb, which was too gamy for my liking. While we were being served the meats we had other side items being served to us. I forgot to mention the appetizer, which were doughy Parmesan rolls with a turkey dip, very good. The side items were fried bananas and some fried potato sticks, which tasted like hash browns. I personally didn't care for the fried bananas but I don't like bananas much anyway.\n\nBelieve it or not we ordered dessert. It didn't come with the meal but I wanted a little something sweet. So we ordered the crème brulee. It stole the show. We finished that off in about five minutes. Maybe the best crème brulee I have ever had. \n\nService was very good and I was pleased. I enjoyed the experience but I wouldn't go back for myself. It's just way too much food and I would rather savor one entree instead of be constantly paraded with more food while I am trying to eat what I have. I would love to go back just for the salad bar and dessert though. They had a lot of other choices for dessert as well. They don't give boxes for your leftovers either so eat up!","date":"2012-02-01 04:09:56"}

Pub-Wings.  Italian - Penne Arrabiata.  Steak - NY Strip.  Sushi - California Roll...and Hakka...Chilli Chicken!\n\nI haven't been to a Hakka place in a while.  I used to go regularly to Wok of Asia when I was assigned to a long term project in the area.  Now that I'm stationed near Hakka Bros., it was great to find this place.\n\nAs I mentioned, I like to try to the Chilli Chicken when I go to a Hakka place for the first time.  Ordered the CC and Soup special - $5.95+tax.\n\nThe Hot and Sour soup was thick and a decent portion for a combo soup.  However, though it had some heat, it didn't have any real flavour.  Added a bit of salt and that helped.\n\nThe Chilli Chicken portion was generous.  Not a lot of times that I don't finish my meal but I had to give up as I was going into a food coma!  The chicken was moist and the batter was still crispy when served.  It had nice heat with about the right amount of peppers.  The rice however was a bit of a mess as it smelled off.  The trials and tribulations of going there well after the lunch hour.  \n\nIf I had to rank my CC experience, it would be Wok of Asia first, this a close second, Asian Garden, then Hakka 77...dead last...Hakka #1.\n\nNonetheless, this place is a good find.  Without the Yelp App, it would have been another fast food lunch bag letdown.  Probably back there even tomorrow to try the second dish I like at Hakka...General Tso-Toe-Tow-So-or whatever (they really need to figure out a standard way to spell his name!).","date":"2016-10-14 01:38:07"}

Some of the staff is really nice, others are not. Some are just terrible. There was this one lady putting a basket of sunglasses on the rack. A customer next to me, reached across me to grab into the basket. The employee told her she couldn't do that and that she would have to wait for her to set them on the rack. Which I understand, because the glasses would be all over the floor if the customer went diving into them.

For a Tuesday night, it was pretty busy but certainly not full. The food was not bad, not the best I've ever had but definitely above average and the service was pretty good!\n\nI had a glass of the Pinot Grigio which I enjoyed. I notice the list of white wines was a bit smaller. There were a lot more red wine choices and most of the choices were for entire bottles. The prices were a bit on the higher side but it's a beautiful restaurant in Yorkville so that's to be expected.\n\nI had the spinach salad which was good but I found there were too many sweet elements. The salad dressing was a strawberry vinaigrette and there were figs and dried cranberries and some sort of crispy onions and bocconcini cheese. I would have enjoyed a goats cheese or something to cut the sweetness of it. The elements were fresh tasting however. We also ordered the burrata appetizer that came with a sizable ball of burrata cheese and prosciutto on a bed of arugula. The burrata was delicious and the portion was good for the price. \n\nI had the gnocchi as my main, which while was filling, was a small portion on a huge plate. I saw some other dishes like the lasagna and pizzas and panzerotti and they were a lot larger. Maybe I'd go with one of those options next time. The pasta was also somewhat mediocre in my opinion, the sauce wasn't the best and the ricotta on top didn't really add much to it. \n\nSince we were there for a birthday, we also got a Nutella pizza to share. I love Nutella so that was good but I found the crust to be really chewy in some parts and burnt in other parts. There were also a total of 5 banana slices on the pizza and a few hazelnuts sprinkles on top. It was a nice after dinner treat but it wasn't amazing. \n\nThe service was pretty good. The food came a bit slow but it's not a fast food restaurant so you can't expect that. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. Modern and warm and stylish. The kitchen is open so you can see the pizzas being made which is really cool. \n\nOverall this is a nice spot for dinner. The prices are on the higher side but not outrageously so, especially for the area. It's definitely a cool, stylish place with pretty good food.

It was not what we expected, definitely feels like its been around for a long time and we were underwhelmed when we entered.

They have two simulators added on each end of the dome but they are not the focus. This is primarily a driving range. It has an upper and lower level. They have clubs that you can use or bring your own. The driving range was fun but very confusing as to how you are assigned a spot. Seemed like everyone was just trying to fit in where there was an opening yet some people would come in saying they were assigned to #5....we were all confused. Staff is limited and are teenagers, not very organized process. Simulator was fun but depending on the number of people you have you'll need more time. There were five of us and we didn't even complete 3 holes in one hour. They do have a concession stand but is limited to what they provide and no alcohol.

We opted out of taking the ambulance because you know...thats expensive. Well my roommate and I regret that. We waited 3 hours in the lobby. My roommate had shortness of breath and sever abdominal pain, on the paperwork it says if either one of those is in your symptoms then notify hospital staff for immediate assistance. So of course I let them know but we still waited for 3 hours, if it was super serious, I am sure my roommate would be passed out in the lobby by then. The lady with glasses and long hair, a little on the bigger side, was very rude and showed no care what so ever when I told her that my roommate could not breath. So finally after 3 hours we get called in, they do some basic tests then send us back out to the lobby again. Another hour later we finally got admitted in. The nurse Shaundra is amazing! She was very friendly and helpful along with an EMT guy named Ben Davis. Both of them were amazing but unfortunately we lost them after 40 minutes because of a shift change and we ended up getting really grumpy staff. The doctor during the whole situation was a little off, she kept laughing for no reason when she would explain what was wrong with my roommate. I don't know if that is a medical issue she is going through herself but I felt it was a little unprofessional to laugh while explaining what is wrong with a patient. Anyways my roommate had 1 ultrasound and 2 cts. Seven hours later, waiting in the hospital, they finally gave us some results and said that they don't know what is causing the pain and shortness of breathe but you also have gastritis and a few cysts on your ovaries but thats not what causing your symptoms but here is your medicine for the other stuff. Have a good night. So my roommate was sent home still in severe pain because the hospital could not figure out what was going on. Very helpful.

The sandwich was just as you'd imagine, but the egg and mornay sauce add so much to it.  The mornay sauce was rich and velvety smooth.  The egg enhanced the sandwich the same way adding a fried egg to a cheese burger does.\nIt also came with pommes frites, or in english, \"french fries\", and a whole mound of them!  So much that a table of 4 could not finish them.   They were really good, maybe in the top 5 fries ever.  After all who makes French fries better than the French?  Well maybe McDonnalds... Wait, did i just compare Bouchon to McDonnalds?  Anyway they were light, crispy, and delicious.\n\nWe also ordered french beignets.  I was expecting something like the beignets in New Orleans where they are light and covered with powdered sugar.  These were a bit heavier and both resembled and tasted like cake doughnuts.  Although they were warm and probably the best cake doughnut I've ever had, it was not what i was expecting and was a bit of a let down.  I would have been fine with it, but when it was brought to the table they said, \"your doughnuts.\"  Let's get one thing straight here, I'd gladly pay $8 for 3 french beignets, but NOT for 3 doughnuts!  \n\nPros:  Great bakery items especially the Croissant, Tons of delicious french fries, delicious meals with great sauces. \n\nCons: Beignets are okay but not the type you find in New Orleans, definitely not worth $8 for 3 the size of \"Hostess Donettes\".   \n\nAdvice:  There is a embosser next to the entrance with some pieces of thick card stock.  you can emboss the bouchon name in it for a keep sake.  not sure if you're supposed to do it or what it's for but i did, and now use it as my bookmark.","date":"2009-10-14 02:53:46"}

While it's not the most adventurous meal of my life, it did delight me with all my favorites -- a black truffle trio, osetra caviar, foie gras, duck, Santa Barbara uni, etc... and an incredibly beautiful 3 course dessert.  It is culinary perfection in the most romantic setting. What more could you ask for? More Caviar? Well, you probably won't because their caviar portions are the most generous I've seen! Bonus points for them there. \n\nI could describe the food, but if you're a foodie like me, you already know the drill -- The food is good so I will not describe every dish. You get everything that is absolutely delicious, cooked to perfection, and plated beautifully.  And the ambiance, while some may say is gaudy, is very thoughtful and there is much to appreciate about it. The walled garden in one room, a beautiful welcoming bar in another, etc.... there is much to appreciate about this place and Joel Robuchon's attention to detail.\n\nHowever, a few things that needed improvement or felt a little strange: \n1) One of the things I found tacky was the $15 water charge.  If you're charging over $800\/person for the meal plus pairing, water charges should just be waived or just tacked onto the food charge. I see this as a terrible faux pas, especially for a three michelin star restaurant.\n2) Someone was getting on-the-job training at our table. This would be OK but out of the three times I got up to use the restroom, I only found my napkin folded twice.\n3) Joel Robuchon has a fantastic limo service where they pick you up in a limo to the restaurant... but it was not available during \"the holidays\" much to our large party's dismay. It would've been nice to know this when we booked our table.\n4) The soft-boiled egg seemed more like a hard-boiled egg to me. It was cooked on a higher-temperature side of things.\n5) The wait staff is not in sync (all plates put down at the same time, etc...) like they usually are at this level of dining.\n\nThe menu was about $600\/person, and my boyfriend and I split the most basic wine pairing for $250. At that price point, it better be perfect. And it was. But perfection comes with a downside -- it's that I think Joel Robuchon played it very safe. If you're a hardcore foodie, I think you may find the menu slightly on the 'safe' side (and in that case try é by José Andrés).  But if you're here for the Vegas experience and want to try a solid 3-star menu with a fantastic ambiance, this is the place to go. Highly recommend. Definitely more of a 4.5 stars from me.","date":"2015-01-03 22:52:55"}

A friend and I met for a meal on a recent Friday at 11:00am and were seated right away. The menu offers up breakfast and lunch items, many of them comfort food style: chicken n waffles, grilled cheese sandwiches, as well as a Fat Elvis sandwich (French toast, Nutella, bacon, peanut butter, and strawberries).  The 'made to order' part applies to the breakfast, where you can choose a wrap, omelet, or skillet form for options that include avocado, salmon, chicken, chili, and broccoli.\nI had the MTO breakfast:  3 eggs, chicken sausage, 2 slices of turkey bacon, 2 slices of regular bacon, 2 slices of Spam, mash browns, and toast.  Opting for egg whites and sourdough toast, it was a larger than normal meal for me with all of that meat.  The bacon was made just right, but the Spam wasn't cooked long enough and the turkey bacon was buried underneath the eggs and just limp. The chicken sausage was good, too.  The mash browns are a combo of mashed potatoes and hash browns and I enjoyed those very much.  I left one slice of Spam and half a slice of chicken sausage on my plate, full from all that food.  \nI used my Yelp check-in offer of free Walnut Tossies when we got there.  Our server had never seen it before so she took my phone over to another waitress who cleared it with her boss.  Said boss, Ben, came over to our table and introduced himself as one of the owners.  Apparently I was the first person to use the check-in so he asked how it worked on the phone app, I showed him, and he was very happy.  I was happy with the Walnut Tossies at the end of the meal for dessert, 3 little mini-pastries of walnut and brown sugar.  \nOverall, it was a good experience, especially since my friend treated me to this meal.  I don't spend $14 on breakfast on a normal basis, but I'll come back to try some of the lunch items.

This was large enough to fit our entire family of 6 adults in a frame with no issues - masks, hats, wigs, and tiaras and all! Best part of an actual booth vs a photo wall was the ability to have your photos show outside the booth for others to enjoy but you have the privacy to prep your poses for each shot without staring at the rest of the guests waiting in line or having those eating putting a damper on your diva shot! \n\nTwo's company photbooth were very good with the kids; they were patient and were very professional and efficient in managing the booths.  They provided a couple bins of props, signs and costumes and the pictures came out beautifully with our personal touches and messages personalized on the photos.  We were given multiple options when deciding the size of the photos and we were asked how they can customize the template to reflect and match the occasion right down to the message. The photobooth was a blast and we received a lot of compliments on the booth as being one of the highlights of the evening.\n\nHighly recommended!!!","date":"2015-05-12 23:50:40"}

Having got off the plane in Charlotte and looking for a place to eat in town, we came across a place that looked nice and different and was actually open Sunday night.\n\nHarry's is a combination bar\/restaurant in the town of Ayrsley. Surrounding the area are trees, small office buildings and the highway, along with some local businesses and such. When you go in, there is someone to greet you. Directly in front of you is the bar along with some small seating on the left. On the right are some booths and tables for larger parties.\n\nThey have a small menu for food, but a larger menu for drinks and cocktails. I ended up ordering their burger of the day, which came with fries and one other side that I can't remember right now. The burger was big and satisfying and so were the fries, albeit a bit salty.\n\nWhat surprised me was the cleanliness and the amount of service they gave us. The server checked in on us multiple times and so did the manager. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it, but in light of this review, I would consider it a positive aspect to mention.\n\nI wish I were able to review other food spots in the area, but even considering this was our only place that we went to eat out, it was a good choice. The place is good for watching the game, or hanging out with people.","date":"2012-05-29 17:49:23"}

I've witnessed the person behind the counter rub their coworker's neck (greasy curls falling all over their gloves) and then turn to make my burrito; touching my food with the same gloves.  At other times, I've watched them drag the burrito across the counter top, pulling whatever germs were there along with \"my food.\"  On yet another occasion, I witnessed them pulling up a container from behind a burrito belonging to a customer in front of me.  The container dropped a bunch of dirty water onto it.  Needless to say, I watch really carefully now when they make my food.  Also, this location has a few girls working here that are damn annoying; always yelling and laughing to the point of irritation.\n\nTHE SUM-IT-UP:\nGood food but HIGHLY unsanitary at times.  Roll the dice...\n\nUPDATE MONTH'S LATER:  I decided to lower my guard and go here today.  What a mistake.  I ordered the 4 crunchy tacos.  And, where every other decent Chipotle will fill each taco separately - as they indeed should - this one took it to the opposite extreme.  The girl behind the counter was lazy and indifferent. She plopped each of the salsa's on top of the shells, not in them.  By the time she was about to put the lettuce on that I had asked for, I had to stop her.  I said, \"Stop.  Please.  You've completely covered the shells.  I can't even see them any longer.  You've done nothing but make a giant mess that I have to fix up if I'm going to eat a taco that has something in it.\"\n\nShe got all huffy like, \"Well, I never!\"  Too bad.  If nobody tells her that her absolute laziness is making a mess of my meal, she will never change.  (And by the way - it was not busy at the time. In fact, it was nearly dead in there.  She had no good excuse.)\n\nI'll never eat at this sh#thole Chipotle again.  The others aren't so bad, but this location truly - truly - just doesn't give a damn.","date":"2006-05-27 21:51:01"}

Got up, grabbed his stuff, and said some things in Vietnamese about me didn't tell him the right service.   I speak Vietnamese fluently btw.  I felt that by this tech, I wasn't treated with respect.  He totally just bounced, who does that.   Anyways, the front desk guy did apologized for the misunderstanding and now I have to wait for a different guy to finish my nails.

And this is not a good wow at all.\n\nDid NOT expect such bad food here. My fellow diners said they had better steaks from Outback, possibly Sizzler and Cocos.\n\nThe waiters seem programmed to try to upsell everything. The only \"amazing\" food on the menu from the kitchen are the highest priced items. \n\nConsidering how much amazing food is available in Vegas, Beso sucks some major donkey balls. The various managers are completely useless.  The manager we got to \"work\" with Chad Jahn is beyond useless. The consensus is that he's an ex-bouncer and doesn't even know how to manage to make a drink much less manage a high-profile restaurant.\n\nThere seems to be too many staff running around pretending to be busy than actually working.  I saw no less than 3 managers pretty much walking the floor doing nothing.  None of them went up to any tables to inquire about the food, the service or anything that would normally be relevant to their jobs. There were too many hostesses worried about their outfits and make-up and being seen. \n\nNow, onto the food. Again, WOW. It was beyond awful--once it actually came out.  Apparently our ticket got dropped TWICE by the kitchen. And, did any manager come out to apologize and try to make nice? Uh, that'd be a no.\n\nThat's where the wonderful and awfully helpful \/insert sarcasm here Chad came over. And he only came over because we actually asked the waiter where the manager was and why he wasn't the one trying to sooth things over with us.  Instead, we told him what we expected from our service. Comped food, a steep discount and free dessert\/coffee\/tea. At least he had the competency to do that, so I guess there is some hope. BUT, the best part is--he wasn't the one telling us. Our poor waiter was the one breaking the news. Isn't that a manager's job?\n\nThe waiter and his trainee were so sweet and trying to help out, but honestly, what else can they do? I think they pretty much gave up when they knew how much of the dinner was going to be cut, therefore reflecting their tip. We made sure they were compensated for their work. As for the main tab? Aw hale naw.  Took whatever discount they gave us. Normally our group would order 1-2 desserts to share. Yeah, call us greedy and bitter, but we each ordered one.  The sad thing is? Even the dessert took 15 minutes to come out AND it wasn't good.\n\nThe one star was because our waiter actually tried so hard.\n\nFinal report: More style than substance.","date":"2010-01-09 10:34:58"}

There was only one other table occupied and the waiter returned within 1 minute to ask if we knew what we wanted as the kitchen was closing in 5 mins, giving the impression that he would be just as happy if we left. Posted closing time is an early 10 pm. Unfortunately, we stayed...\n\nI sat my reading glasses case down on the table when we arrived. When I went to pick it up to read the menu, it was practically stuck to the table. Classy, eh? After some mediocre tortilla chips and salsa, we both had the combination platter described in the previous review and guava margaritas. All of it was utterly bland, so I asked for some Tabasco. The server informed me there was no Tabasco and was walking away when I called after him asking if they had any other hot sauce instead. He grudgingly brought another very spicy sauce and spent the remainder of the evening cleaning tables, stacking chairs and generally making it clear that he wanted us out of there ASAP. I did manage to request a glass of water from him as he reached across the table mid-meal to remove our candle. The lights were very bright, so I asked another server if they could be turned down. After asking if I wanted to go to sleep (!), she turned them down just a touch, but a few minutes later our waiter turned them on full blast. By this point the place had less ambiance than your average McDonalds at 3 am. No one ever inquired if we were happy with our food (we were not). The hot sauce I'd begged for added the only taste. The 'quesadilla' was practically an empty tortilla. I know where to find much better tacos and enchiladas in Toronto for less money. The margarita was ok, but it wasn't enough to make this joint acceptable.","date":"2013-05-29 03:35:27"}

This was our second visit since their remodel. We were a little apprehensive given some of the bad reviews I read prior to this visit so we actually booked a comped room at the Orleans as back up. We chose to pay for the Plaza because we prefer to stay downtown. I am happy to say we didn't need to use our back up room and stayed all three nights at the Plaza.\n\nCheck was a breeze even though we were there at 1pm, they had 5 people working so the line moved very quickly and since I had picked up a $2 Coors before getting in line I was fine with the wait. Robert at check in was very pleasant and since I explained my apprehension to him he worked very hard to make sure we had a good room. He really wanted to make sure we had a good floor but couldn't get us a King bed on the floor he wanted for us so I took the two queens which isn't a real big deal. I couldn't be happier with his service.\n\nWe were given a very nice room in the south tower on the 21st floor with a nice view of the strip. The room was as we remembered from our last visit. The furnishings are nice and in good shape. the bed's were comfortable but the pillows were a little lacking. The room was clean and believe me we checked thoroughly before unpacking. The room is good size for Downtown. The only things I would have liked the room to have would be a coffee maker (we brought our own instead) and a refrigerator (which is rare downtown except at the Main street Station). The floor we were on was quite and didn't smell of smoke. In fact I think in the three nights there I only saw one other person on the floor. Maid service was always prompt and thorough. She even left a couple extra waters for us each day (probably due to a nice tip every morning).\n\nThe Casino at the Plaza is ok. We played some slot machines and the electronic crap machine a lot. Drink service was good. We mainly play Blackjack though and I don't care to much for the tables there. We prefer the double deck 3\/2 at the Cal. We did play one evening with some of the Girls around the dancing stage. Even though they pay 6\/5 and use auto shufflers, which I hate, the girls were actually very funny and we had a good time. We did play at the craps table a few times and the dealers were all very nice and friendly.\n\nWe saw a couple of comedians at the comedy club one night. The tickets were a little overpriced for the show, even with the 2 for 1 coupon, but we had fun and didn't feel to bad about doing it. The drinks at Z bar while we waited for the show to start were great.\n\nIsland Sushi is a nice little place, prices are great and the food was very good. the fish tasted fresh and clean. The sizes were a little small but given the price I cant complain to much we just ordered more. \n\nPop up Pizza is amazing especially at 1 or 2 am after drinking vodka and playing cards all night. \n\nThe Mexican place in the food court has a great breakfast burrito.\n\nAll in all a nice trip especially since I am a rate watcher and got all three nights over the weekend with resort fee for $128 total. \n\nThe Plaza is perfect for downtown stays. Right there for all the action but not so in the middle of it that it is crazy and loud like the D. It was nice to walk thru all of the noise and madness of Freemont on a Saturday night to come back to the Plaza and leave all of that on the other side of the street. We will be back for sure.","date":"2013-10-03 17:44:34"}

There were few vegetables, mostly carrots, and no attempt at any sort of condiment (peanuts, vinegar, fish sauce, etc.) other than a few bean sprouts. The Sriracha was really what saved the dish. The tofu was barely warm and pretty chewy.\n\nThe menu, and items therein, seem to be developed to appeal to broad and bland american palate. There are around 20 noodle dishes in three different categories, \"Asian\", \"Mediterranean\", and \"American\" as well as 5 sandwich dishes.\n\nOverall strikes me as a Panera Bread trying to piggy back on fresh concepts like Chipotle's success.

So many other things looked amazing on the menu we will certainly be back to try then out!!! William brought over the dessert tray & made some recommendations. 2 Chocolate things we ordered...1 with Williams recommendation of Godiva liquor poured over it........AWESOME.

The salon is really nice and clean. The spa is on the top floor and it is very quiet and relaxing. The staff is super friendly, they offered me tea (and I dont even like tea but this one was really good). The girl who took care of me was Eva. She is super nice and friendly, and she did a fantastic job. She makes you feel very relaxed and comfortable and her massages are amazing. The facial was 70$+tip. My face is usually extremely red after a facial because I have very sensitive skin, but yesterday was not bad at all. The extractions doesn't hurt compared to other places. The only cons would be that the don't extract milia around the eyes, and I would have liked a deeper extraction. Very good experience overall. I will definitely be back!\n\n*UPDATED:\nAll the skin products I bought (cleanser, moisturizer, toner and essential oil) gave me really bad allergic reactions. Be careful if you have sensitive skin as a big number of Aveda products contain lavender. Lavender is NOT good for sensntive skin EVER. I had a terrible rash all over my face for 3 weeks. I could return the products but they gave me a gift card, not cash back. Now I have 150$ in an Aveda card that most likely I'll give to someone because I am not going to use any of their products ever again. So be careful if you have sensitive skin. Try little samples before buying any skincare product.","date":"2013-08-15 15:40:13"}

I went here because I wanted to meet a friend relatively close to Union Station and wanted to eat something good. There are a lot of pricier joints downtown so I opted for Corrado's. It looked like it was going to be cheap + delicious arancini and italian-style sandwiches. I was rather disappointed when I actually ate it.\n\nI love arancini. I love rice, and love rice with creaminess. And fried, crispy breading? Arancini is a delicious union of the two. Unfortunately Corrado's arancini doesn't quite measure up. Sure, they're pretty big, and the filling is actually creamy and tasty, but I don't see the point of smothering the arancini with tomato sauce as you can't taste any of the crunch or crispiness of the breading, and makes it just taste like I made rice with cream of mushroom sauce and pasta sauce. \n\nThe sandwich wasn't anything spectacular either. I much prefer Porchetta, Club Sandwich, or even my own sandwiches. Maybe the other menu options are better. Who know's, I'd much rather spend my time and money elsewhere.","date":"2016-04-23 02:57:19"}

Makes life more exciting. But I digress...\n\nWent with a friend and we both ordered Thai Curry, which consists of veggies and tofu in the curry paste I believe.  I was in the mood for rice noodles and had that added and replaced the tofu with textured vegetable protein (TVP), along with extra spicy.  Like, hot hot. :) \n\nThe TVP takes some getting used to.  For me personally, I liked it at the beginning but not as much at the end.  It was very different for me but the dish itself was yummy and had a light curry flavour.  Fresh peppers, onion, cabbage, etc.  The spicy was light for my taste.  It might have been the fact that I asked for them to add more stuff to the dish to make it spicy, but it kept leaking over the side onto the table.  Had to keep mopping it up with a napkin.  \n\nFor dessert I ordered vanilla bean ice cream made from coconut milk. Couldn't go without a double chocolate chip vegan cookie.  Kind of funny but I envisioned the ice cream sitting on top of the cookie and never mentioned it, but that's how it was brought to the table.  Crazy.  Like they read my mind.  \n\nStaff were really friendly and attentive as well.  Cute little place to visit.","date":"2013-12-07 03:21:27"}

Great location in a modern building. The problem was more with the kitchen than anything else.\n\nCame when there wasn't a crowd and was asked to sit inside or outside. Chose inside and was seated quickly in the middle of a long row of tables.  Waitress was very friendly and the service was quite good. We ordered and waited.\n\nMy stepdaughter had the Kobe burger and asked for it to be 'medium', it was rare. My girlfriend asked for the Turkey burger, it was under cooked with a soft white center and had to be sent back to the kitchen. I had the Samburger which as a burger with bacon on it. I asked for it to be medium rare and got it very rare.  I like rare anyway, but not what I had asked for. The buns were nice and soft and the flavor was ok.  On the bright side, the loaded fries were very good, according to my stepdaughter.\n\nThere is a lot of new competition in Gilbert and not performing well is not going to help. I am sure other Yelpers liked this place, but it will not be one of my top picks.  I will try it again in a month or two to see if they have fixed their kitchen.

I can't stand acrylic because make my nails look too big and thick, I liked SNS powder but it would break very easily. So I decided to give hard gel a try and I went to LV Nails based on the reviews on Yelp. I was not disappointed! They fit me in same day, I got a full set and pedicure, that was PERFECT, for $100. Now that certainly isn't the cheapest I've ever paid, but you get what you pay for! And it was a very fair price. I've never had a better pedicure than the one I got from LV Nails and Spa. I have odd shaped toenails because when I was younger I used to rip them off rather than cut them down so they grow a little weird and pedicures usually get on my nerves because my entire nail is not painted. Of course it's easily chipped and they neglect the very sides of the nail bed but not here! They have the biggest variety of nail colors in regular polish and hard gel so I had a hard time picking what I wanted but it's a good problem to have! My full set was done by Kim and I can't remember the name of the awesome lady who did my toes, but I definitely want to go to her again! Kim was really professional and sweet. Made sure to ask me if I wanted water a few times, made sure I liked the shape, made sure I liked the color. She made sure to check in with me every step of the way to ensure that I was satisfied. Same with the lady working on my pedicure, made sure to asked me about the length and the color and gave me a really nice foot massage. The salon was really gorgeous very clean and friendly staff with friendly patrons. Parking was not a hassle unlike many other salons I've been too, have to drive around for a few minutes just to find a spot, not here parking was not difficult at all. This is definitely my new go-to salon in the Henderson & Las Vegas area.","date":"2017-03-27 03:31:50"}

Thousands of dollars she's quoting. I tell her how much for just pulling the damn tooth.\n\nOK, she explains in order to quote that, since I don't have dental insurance I would have to buy a 1 year dental plan through them that would cost $95. That would entitle me to their \"discount\" procedure rate of $300 to pull the tooth. $300!!! plus the $95 plus the initial $39 and I'm looking at almost $450 to pull a simple tooth!\n\nWell, needless to say I said no.\n\nEven though I paid the $39 (demanded up front when I walked in) which was supposed to include a cleaning and free sonic toothbrush, I was offered and received neither.

The peanut dipping sauce went perfectly with the fried chicken \/ veggie 'smaller version of egg rolls'.  The wife, as predictable as they come, went with the Spicy Chicken Pad Thai mild heat.  This was spot on.  Very tasty, I mean I could eat this 3 days a week for lunch.  It was weird for me to see the whole dish basically reddish orange with sprinkled peanuts and sprouts because I really couldn't tell the difference between the noodles and the carrots.....again, this is my first time here so I quickly realize what a rookie I was.  Mridul went with the Chicken Fried Rice, medium spice, with a scrambled egg inside.  This was really good too, a dish I would recommend if a rice dish is your desire.  I went with the Spicy Pork Pad Thai medium heat for 2 reasons.   1) I originally wanted the chicken but wifey beat me to it and 2) I wanted to see if there was a noticeable difference between chicken and pork, which upon tasting, there really was.  Although all dishes were great, we all decided that the Spicy Chicken Pad Thai was our favorites.  We also all decided that the heat needed to be upgraded to the medium level, not mild.  \n\nWhat a great first time.  I will be back and also want to try Pad Thai somewhere else to see how it compares.  Very cute place, and really reasonable.  Be forewarned though, they only take cash.","date":"2010-11-22 16:34:58"}

I asked the server if it could be made with flour tortillas instead of corn but she tried arguing with me (her name was Yolanda) that Enchiladas cant be made with flour tortillas because it wont hold together.

Totally not what I had expected from the looks of the exterior.  \n\nFrom moderately priced champagnes to ultra high end bordeaux, they have a large variety of great wines.  You can even purchase a bottle and open it on the spot for a $10 corkage fee.  \n\nHad heard the food was good, which is why we came - and I was not disappointed.  Since it was sunday, it was mostly brunch items, but pretty much everything we tried was very tasty.  A few dishes of note:\n\n-Buckwheat crepes: savory crepes are usually salty due to the sauce that's poured on.  Not the case here.  Crepe was soft and tender, with the chicken and mushroom going together nicely, and a light thyme creme sauce to tie it all together.  \n\n-Croque madame: frenchy countryside comfort food.  Love me a good thick piece of bread, and boy, their pain di mie was amazing.  Thick cuts of ham and two gooey over-easy eggs to tie it all together.  Yum.\n\n-Lobster salad croissant: There's something really good about home made pastries and bread.  No corner cutting here.  Fresh lobster meat, mixed with creamy avocado, piled on top of a fresh baked croissant.  \n\nThe kids really dug the lake view and hung around quietly watching the turtles swim around, while the adults ate and socialized.

The reviews here are mostly good. I had the Tangerine Chicken. I realize that this probably isn't a great dish to review a Chinese place on, however this was rather disappointing. The atmosphere is comfortable and calm. [Most Chinese places I've been to are completely opposite of this] Also for a Saturday night they didn't have many people. [Saturday night is suppose to be a busy night]\n\nSome of the issues I found:\n1. The booths are quite old. If someone is sitting behind you it is very possible for them to push the booth into you. This is quite bothersome, and I had to move because of this reason. \n2. Price, it wasn't that bad. It was about $10 for an entree, nearly $2 for a drink and the meal ended up being $16-17 after tip.\n3. Service: I have no complaints. I'm not very picky on service, so I have no complaints.\n4. Value: For the quality, I wouldn't say the value is very high. They did give a lot of quantity.\n5. The food. This is the thing that bothered me the most. The Tangerine chicken was just chicken. There weren't any vegetables to compliment or to round out the plate. The chicken was chicken battered in tangerine peels, and their batter. Each ball of chicken was [with breading] about 2-3 inches in diameter. The chicken is covered in \"brown sauce.\" The cirtus flavor was only if you had a taste of the fried remains of the tangerine peel. Also, this dish was claimed to be spicy, however from the looks of it, the only spicy element was entire chiles that had been added later to the sauce. \n\nHow could the food have been better. INAPC [I'm not a professional chief], but:\n1. Balance out the dish. Add less deep fried items to the dish. I had never gotten an typical Chinese restr. dish that was deep fried and didn't have some kind of vegetables. \n2. There was NO citrus flavor. If you want the flavor you're going to have to put it in the sauce. It is nearly impossible to favor via the meat via its breading. The chemical reaction completely kills most flavroids. \n3. Don't reuse the sauce. Create a spicy sauce and crush up those peppers. Just putting them in the sauce and heating it up at the last minute won't make it spicy. Add heat to the dish and stick by it. If it says spicy on the menu it should be intended to be spicy.","date":"2011-11-30 05:44:31"}

I arrived at the restaurant at 2:48 pm and stood at the courier pickup counter.  There was a young lady running the register, and a manager with headset delegating tasks to the staff visible from my view point.  The manager walked past me numerous times, hyper focused on bags and monitors and never once glanced at me to make eye contact.  At no point did he even acknowledge my presence.  After 8 minutes of standing there, I finally locked on and said HEY, is the ubereats order ready yet?  \n\nHis response to me was \"You should have spoken up, I can't read your mind\".  This response is the most unprofessional and rude interaction I have ever had at any restaurant while doing deliveries.  This man has clearly no sense of customer service, and the fact that he is a supervisor, with an entire staff of employees within earshot, is a galactic worry.  This is whom they are taking their cues from.  \n\nSo, I will speak up.  Greeting customers and making eye contact with them is the very basic first steps to customer service, across all chains and brands and industries.  And customer service is the business you are in, Mr. Manager.  Your deluded belief that customers should scream at the top of their lungs to get your attention is ridiculous, especially as you've closed yourself off to all interaction by talking loudly in your headset, fidgeting with bags and monitors, and basically ignoring everything human in site.  Don't you think that would intimidate people and make them second guess approaching you?  I have the answer, and the answer is yes.  \n\nI will never again do a food delivery at this location.  I can guarantee you I am not the only one, because often times I am pinged from 10 miles away from this restaurant to do a delivery.  Really?  There's nobody within 10 miles if this place that is willing to go there?  There is a reason!  Corporate needs to take a look at this franchise and consider revoking the license.

I order the DIY Omelette with almost every \"topping\" option. A few of the items I chose were missing, but it took a decent amount of time to receive our food, and I was starving, so I ate it anyway. It was delicious! I expected it to come with toast or something, but it was just an omelette on a plate. For $11, that's borderline too expensive for just an omelette IMO. I also ordered a side of homefries for $3, which were equally good. Two other things...\n\nWhile our server was pleasant enough, service was slow. Granted, we had a party of six, but the party of three beside us also seemed to experience excessive wait times as well.\n\nIn my 3 short months as a parent this is the first restaurant I've encountered without a changing table. Even though it's been only 3 months, we go out a LOT, so it's interesting that this is the first time this has happened. I sort of just stood there, and after a bit of thought, decided to use my portable changing pad on the entryway bench.

Let's just add sex and penis jokes with zombies because people love zombies and sex!\" Who though this would be a good idea? \nTacky middle school penis jokes, unoriginal racist blacks and asian jokes, and overall poor storyline. The host is supposed to carry the show along, but instead I felt he stalled the momentum of the show. There were times I seriously wanted to shout out, \"Get on with it! We get it, they have a penis!'' \nThey poorly incorporated the zombie aspect of it. They created the show around the idea that zombies are hypersexual beings and kept trying to hammer that into the show. Zombies loves sex. Zombies love sex. There, I just told you the whole show. \n\nI honestly couldn't understand the singing. I don't know if it's because of my seat but I had to seriously concentrate to understand what they were singing about, especially the host. Fast talking and slurred singing doesn't make for a good show. I've been to multiple musicals and shows, I've never had to concentrate so hard. The storyline was lost on me. \n\nThe theater is a long rectangle so the seat just continually goes upward instead of outward like most theaters. If you get stuck near the back and at the left end of the row, there's a huge block of wall that juts out blocking your view. You'll have to encroach on the people to your right to get a better view. \n\nThe only good thing about the show was that they had a live band. I'd rather listen to the live band play for 90 minutes than slurred singing and overused sex jokes.","date":"2016-12-19 14:16:49"}

The menu is big enough where there is something for everyone and usually everyone walks away happy. Lately though, the quality of the food as gone way down. \n\nBefore I went vegetarian I used to always get the chicken waldorf salad and it was always so good. I love the blue cheese and the candied walnuts. They were addicting. Since I've become vegetarian I settled on the hummus appetizer, grilled vegetable salad, and the wild mushroom pizza. Recently though, they have completed revamped the menu, adding new items, taking old favorites off. For some places, menu changes mean new and exciting food opportunities and makes the visit to that place even better. Not for CPK. \n\nRecently, since beginning to use yelp, I have wanted to try new places and veer away from old favorites or places that I am used to. However, I tend to have friends and family members who are food-borists... Ya I just invented a new word. A food-borist is someone who never wants to try anything new, and will eat at the same place and order the same exact thing all of the time. My friends are this way. It never fails. Any time one of them has a birthday I get an invitation to eat at CPK and every time I groan. Even before I swore off CPK forever, I was getting extremely tired of it. The second to the last time I went was for my birthday with some friends. I ordered the new roasted vegetable salad and a cup of the vegetarian tortilla soup. I used to love the grilled vegetable salad and was pissed when they replaced it on the menu with roasted vegetable salad. Not good. I struggled through it because my friends paid for my dinner and I didn't want to waste their money. But it was gross, and I vowed never to order it again. The soup was good though. The last time I went was with my sister, husband and niece. This time I ordered the new caramelized peach salad. On the menu, most of the new items sound really good. Its just the execution of them that fails CPK. The peach salad was gross. The peaches were canned and then warmed, and I also saw no caramelization whatsoever. The combination of the peaches with the gorgonzola (my favorite cheese of all time) was so unappetizing. I didn't even get through half of the salad before I said forget it. My husband ordered the garlic cream fettuccine and added sauteed mushrooms and was upset by this as well. The portion size was really small and it was extremely salty. My sister ordered the barbecue cobb salad which was almost entirely jicama. She barely ate half as well because it was just a giant jicama salad! They skimped on all of the other items in the salad and just pretty much covered some jicama in barbecue dressing. \n\nThe pricing at CPK has also become outrageous. It was almost $13 for my salad. For a salad! Does anyone else find that wrong? Considering the ingredients, my salad should have cost $7, tops! Pasta is expensive, pizzas were generally reasonable for awhile but those prices have been raised as well. For such a casual dining place the prices are just exorbitant. The service also sucks. Our waitress probably spent two minutes total the entire meal at our table. No refilled waters, no how is everything. She was just rushing around everyone else's table except ours. \n\nSo we all have made a vow never to return to any CPK. Especially the one in the Chandler Fashion Center. Before I went vegetarian, I got a lovely surprise one morning after eating here and was graced with food poisoning for two days. That was a great experience.","date":"2011-08-24 23:50:01"}

It's relatively cheap and the food itself has never been an issue. However, on at least two occasions, the order I received was not the exact order I had placed. For instance, one time I specifically requested and according to the bill paid the additional fee for bacon to accompany my chocolate chip pancakes, but to my disappointment, no bacon received.\n\nRecently, bf and I decided to treat ourselves to breakfast across the street. It was the first time we actually had the dine in experience. Not impressed! We got there shortly after 9 am to beat the morning rush but the place itself was already so noisy. We could barely hear each other across the table. The majority of the noise, in my opinion, stemmed from the staff talking over each other and calling out across the room for each other. Furthermore, as we witnessed, the waitress was rude to several different customers on occasions. No tact. No quality customer service. Lastly, because of the limited seated capacity of the establishment, by the end of our meal, we were sharing our table with a random gentleman.

Vapiano straddles these distinctions with technology.  Each customer gets a \"credit card\" to track their purchases then pays upon leaving.  Maybe that works better for pizzas and large shared plates, but it is a bit awkward for couples and small groups.  And if you want something else (another drink, dessert, etc.), you have to go re-order at the appropriate counter.  Sort of awkward in my opinion.\n\nVapiano's concept strongly emphasizes interior design - it even says so on their web page.  And while that is all well and good, two true tests of a restaurant are the quality of the food and the cleanliness of the environment.  Vapiano scores moderately well on the food (slightly better than average Italian), but falters significantly on cleanliness.\n\nAfter my food was prepared, I took the tray to a nearby table.  I placed the tray down and noticed there were very small winged insects crawling on the table.  Not sure what they were - really small termites or large aphids?  Bugs and food - not a good combination!  So I changed table two more times and still there were bugs on the tables.  Maybe they were there because of the plants in the restaurant?  I don't know, but since I already had my food, I chose the \"least buggy\" table and finished my meal as quickly as I could.  Guess it could be at least as buggy as sitting outside or having a picnic?  The moderate mid-week crowd that was there seemed to not notice this problem.\n\nThe last table I selected was along the left-side of the restaurant, where there are long white drapes made of a sort of gauzy material.  The drapes hang down to almost table surface height and the tables are perpendicular to the windows.  Well, you can guess what comes next - looking at the drapes, you can easily see that they were absolutely filthy, stained by who-knows-how-many previous meals.  While pasta and marinara sauce can be a bit messy, whoever thought to put white drapes next to a table surface wasn't much of a designer.  A simple solution would have been to rotate the tables 90-degrees so they were parallel with the drapes - harder to stain that way.  Another good solution - replace the drapes with clean ones, or remove them altogether!\n\nAs I left to pay, the hostess asked me how my meal was.  I mentioned the bugs and stains, but she seemed oblivious to this.  Had she heard it before?  Did she not care?  I paid and left.\n\nInsects and a dirty environment are a deadly combination for future success.  This location needs to get its act together - get rid of the tiny little buggers and clean the drapes.\n\nI give this Vapiano location 3 stars (average) for food, but ZERO stars for cleanliness.","date":"2013-07-12 22:29:06"}

After a fun afternoon of day drinking my boyfriend and I decided we needed to fill our bellies with delicious pho and drunken noodles. I've been wanting to try this place because of the Yelp reviews and it didn't disappoint. We were greeted by the owner and a very friendly order taker (Leslie). We were sad to find out they had just run out of broth for the pho and were also out of the drunk AF noodles. However, this turned out to be a blessing in disguise because we ended up trying a variety of other equally delicious foods.  \n\nFirst up we ordered The Big Wang and it was awesome.  It came on a huge baguette and was loaded with strips of tender beef, cucumbers, a spicy (but not too spicy) Wang sauce), and Asian slaw. Side note: The Big Wang was listed as the top 11 best sandwiches you must try in Nevada. I can see why, seriously!\n\nI wanted to try the Bang Bang Sliders and figured they would be little appetizer sized. Umm wrong, they were HUGE! Set between soft pretzel bread these sliders were overflowing with tender pulled pork, siam slaw, cukes and onions, and that tasty Wang sauce. You get 3 large sliders so plenty to take home.\n\nLeslie recommended the Bangkok Burrito and we thought hey why not? Another excellent choice. This monstrously huge burrito came stuffed with curry chicken, chicken fat rice, and bamboo shoots. Again we could only eat about a third of it and in the take out box the rest went.  \n\nWe were brought an order of Dirty chips on the house since they were out of the Pho and Drunk AF noodles.  They were like Asian nachos, were delicious, and we ate the whole damn thing with no apologies. Leslie also brought us samples of the homemade ice cream. My boyfriend liked the cereal milk flavor the best but passion fruit was my favorite. Total bill came to $38 but we easily got 2 meals out the deal. We're definitely coming back to try the Pho and drunken noodles soon! Like as in tomorrow.\n\nThis place really is \"Phoking\" Phonomenal!!","date":"2017-01-27 19:50:27"}

Cute little shop with seating off to the left. The employees were not friendly nor rude. They were just... there. However, the lady who brought out our to-go bag was really nice. Most of the ice cream flavors were \"OUT\" (written in chalk on their massive menu board). This was 2 hours before closing so that might have had something to do with it. Still, there were some flavors that I would have loved to try but was unable to and that was disappointing.\n\nThey have metal spoons for the ice cream samples - that was unique and something I've never seen before.\n\nSampled the Turkish Coffee and French Toast ice cream, both were yummy but the french toast won (hands down!!!).\n\nI just realized that I wasn't offered the little \"sample\" scoop on top of my french toast ice cream. I'll be sure to ask for it when I go next time. Seems kind of odd that I have to ask though. If that's their \"thing\", they should offer it to every customer, each time ice cream is ordered. Oh well.\n\nMy husband and I also bought fries. He ordered the cheddar bacon fries - pretty tasty with lots of cheese and bacon bits and 1 side of ranch.\n\nI ordered the chicken tenders and fries which came with 1 side of honey mustard (which tasted more like mustard with a hint of honey). A boring and safe choice and it tasted, well... boring and safe.\n\nThe fries are rather expensive for what they are though. The pictures of the pizza fries look good but the price, along with it being extra $$$ for pepperoni (wth?), I will surely pass.\n\nI will most likely make my way back for the ice cream, but not for the fries unless I'm starving and nothing else around seems appetizing.

I walked through the front door and was not greeted by either a hostess or any other employee. I traipsed toward the bar and was also not greeted by either of the two bartenders behind the bar. I continued forward and finally found a nice young lady whom I asked about seating. She retrieved a server and I requested to be sat on the patio. The patio was empty and I chose a corner table. My waiter informed me that he would be right back and would bring me a menu.\n\nAfter bringing a menu back, I inquired as to whether or not there were any beer specials ongoing. I was dismayed to find out that their refrigeration system was on the fritz and they only had three beers available: New Castle Brown Ale and two run-of-the-mill, piss-poor domestics. I chose the New Castle.\n\nAfter receiving my drink, I ordered from their very straightforward menu after asking the server what his personal favorite menu item was. The \"Four Tacos Plato\" with blackened fish was selected, and off went the server.\n\nI received my food in a very timely manner and it was piping hot. Everything tasted fresh and it looked well-constructed.\n\nMy only complaint was the portion size. The tacos were listed under the \"Large Plate\" section of the menu, but the tacos themselves were quite small. They were more reminiscent of street tacos as opposed to restaurant fare. Regardless, the service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable, the food was quite good and the atmosphere (at least from where I was sitting; on the outside looking in) seemed warm.\n\nAll-in-all, I can recommend it to others, but I can't say that it is a five-star establishment.","date":"2012-12-05 04:23:36"}

My parents and I went in today to pick up an order of undhia and bhajia at 6pm. They had pre-ordered it and arranged the pick up time. We were told to wait for 5 minutes, which we did with no problem. 5 minutes turned into 10, 15, and almost 20. When it finally came out my father rightly expressed concern about the timing since we were ordering a very large amount for a special event. The owner snidely replied, well, if you are so concerned, then why are you even ordering from us? \nUmmm, say what? \nFirst rule of customer service, the customer is always right. And even if they are obnoxious, which we were not, you APOLOGIZE for being late. And you don't make snide comments. \nAnd here's the kicker, we let it slide because there were other people in the store, and when we got home we realized we had gotten the WRONG order, we had 2 orders of bhajias. So we called the owner, Hetal, to note this error. Instead of an apology (at this point we were owed two) we got her adamant denial that she was in the wrong. No, it was us who had placed a wrong order. My father expressed his disapproval of her behavior and you know what she said? I don't have to listen to you, I've opened restaurants before, I don't need to be told how to run it. \nUM, actually, you do. Because you are RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL, and cocky enough to think that just because your food is good, you can get by with the worst service I have ever encountered. This is America, you can't treat your customers like this and get away with it. \nAnd it's such a shame, because in this small indian community of Charlotte, one wants to spread the word about their fellow indian's business and help them out.

The Italian beef tastes about as Chicago-authentic as authentic gets - so much au jus too! The cheese fries were decent - maybe a little too salty for my taste, but in general good. I think my combo + a drink have been about $8 - great value! A few of my coworkers have gotten their Chicago hotdogs and love them too! \n\nA little bit of the Midwest in the heart of the West warms this native Midwesterner's heart.","date":"2016-01-04 05:06:21"}

From a distance, it looks glamorous and fun.\n\nUp close, it's a different story.\n\nUp close, it just makes me sad.  I feel sad because if tourists come here from other countries and base their opinion of the US solely on what they see on the Strip, they would think we are a bunch of overweight alcoholics, who wear clothes that are much too tight and short, and that we want prostitutes to come to our hotel rooms in 10 minutes.  \n\nI know, I sound like a prude. But as I see another drunk young lady, teetering in ridiculous heels, valiantly chugging from a yard long plastic vessel full of some sugary sweet, booze-filled drink, I have to wonder if she is really having fun or if she just thinks she is.\n\nAnother thing that is particularly depressing to me is the women who are handing out cards for \"dates\" that you can have in your hotel room in 10 minutes.  Do they understand what they are doing to these other women, who are someone's sister, daughter, mother?\n\nWalking down the Strip at night, I pray for humanity.   \n\nIn the morning, it's actually pretty nice though and a good place for a run.","date":"2014-09-25 11:53:32"}

The chopped turkey & feta salad is what I had today.  I had them add asparagus, which was a great call if I may say so myself!  The large salad and fresh roll is the perfect lunch... fresh, filling, healthy enough, and pretty inexpensive when it comes to designer salads around town.  I also like the spinach, pancetta & goat cheese and the veggie & aged parmesan salads.  \n\nMy husband eats at Sauce often as well... he goes for a salad or sandwich.  Last time we were there together, he had the salami, turkey, prosciutto & mozzarella panini.  I had a bite and was pleasantly surprised! It had a nice balance of thin sliced meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and tangy red wine vinegar in between two perfectly grilled pieces of bread.  The thin crust pizzas are pretty decent also.  Depending on your appetite, sharing a pizza and a salad with your companion can work out to be a satisfactory meal... \n\nWhat I like about Sauce the most?

After another 5 minutes I decided it wasn't worth my time to wait around, it didn't seem like anyone cared that I was there. My second experience I actually got an appointment but the lady was snippy because we were a few minutes late. Ok fine, sorry I was a little late, but this set my two year old off on the wrong foot. We want this to be a positive experience for him and are expecting that out of a children's salon. He could totally read her negativity and was afraid to get in the chair, normally he is very good about haircuts. My third and final attempt to go to Little Snips I made an appointment and showed up on time only to discover a closed sign on the door. The sign said \"will return at 1\", my appointment was for 12:30. Luckily instead of just waiting I decided to call and the message on the answering machine said they decided to close for the day due to weather. Thanks a lot for calling and letting me know!!! I had no problem loading up my two kids and making it there on time, so I really don't understand why they closed.

The mattress was comfortable, the towels were soft and there was good water pressure in the shower.\nWe stayed in the winter and the room was toasty warm.\nFrom our room you could hear the traffic noise, especially due to the wet roads, and the room is above a bar. From the bathroom we could hear distant voices, maybe from the bar or from an adjoining room, but it wasn't a problem. I could hear people walking in their room on third floor a couple of times.\nThe thing that was a surprise as far as noise were the trains that went through in the wee hours of the morning. We had arrived after dark and didn't notice that a railway crossing was right outside our window one story down, and at least twice trains went by and blew their horns a few toots as they passed the intersection.\nWe had some drinks, including complimentary ones for our stay, at the Up North, and the bartender told us we could take drinks and popcorn up to the room if we would like.\nThe Hotel Ruby Marie was a charming stay and I would stay again if I were looking to spend some time in the area.","date":"2015-01-18 15:02:00"}

The food was incredible, the drinks were strong and remarkably tasty, and the feeling at the restaurant was just very upbeat and lively.  To begin we had wine and a bourbon based pre made cocktail. I really liked the ingenuity of the cocktail where you're given a bottle instead of having to wait for the crafting each time. We then had the tuna cones, mushroom flatbread, and the brussel sprout salad. The ahi cones had a nice kick with the sauce and the presentation was awesome. The flatbread had more of a pizza feel than your typical flatbread which I enjoyed tremendously. The brussel spirit salad was a nice side with whole pieces of bacon and apple rather than sprinkled as per usual. I like this heartier rendition better. The ambiance of the bar is really nice and the staff were great. I really wish I had a casual bar like this closer to my house on the west side.

We were in town for an event at the Convention Center. \n\nPros:\nFriendliness of the staff! From check in to check out, they were unbelievably accommodating and friendly. \n\nAmenities in the room. Full kitchen (which is the reason we booked there to begin with. A lot of places in Vegas do not have a kitchen). It had a sink, fridge, toaster, stove top, tea kettle, microwave, Keurig coffee maker, and cabinets. As a nice touch, they had Rio Blend coffee in the room. Maybe because of the 2016 Olympics coming up? Also had paper coffee cups, sweeteners, creamer cups, and stirring sticks. Due to county regulations, they are not allowed to keep plates, silverware, etc in the room but will bring them to your room if needed. \n\nThey also included an iron, ironing board, blow dryer, light up mirror, bathrobe, and plenty of fluffy towels. \n\nThe bathroom has a TV inside the mirror. Didn't use it but interesting touch. Spa tub and separate shower. Marble counters and floors. Water heated up VERY quickly. \n\nThe pillows!!! Oh the pillows! I have to find the Downrite brand online or in Macy's or something because they were divine. Beds were comfy too. \n\nOur room even had a DOORBELL on it instead of the bellboy knocking, he rang a door bell! LOL\n\nThe AC was amazing and cooled the room quickly and kept it cool. \n\nVery quiet. We never once heard any other guests. All the appliances in the room were quiet as well. \n\nThe elevators. Fast. Ya know how some hotels you stand there forever waiting on the elevator? Not here. I timed it. It took 13 seconds to get from the 39th floor to the lobby. Unreal. \n\nThe ice machines are in their own little rooms in the hallways so you don't have to listen to someone getting ice in the middle of the night. \n\nIt is right across from a huge mall. Lots of shops and a large food court. \n\nCons:\n\nThe train. Yes, you read that correctly. There was a train that ran behind the hotel where our room was facing that ran every couple of hours throughout the night and woke us up each time. As it came up to an intersection, it would blow its horn over and over. But this is where the nice staff came in handy. They were more than willing and helpful to move us to a room facing The Strip in exchange for a small extra fee because it was a room facing The Strip. We could still hear the train in the distance but not enough to wake us up. We only heard it before heading to bed. \n\nValet. Yes, I know that valet was supposed to be bougie and helpful, however, we found it bothersome. It's just easier to have access to our car when needed. On the other hand there was a relatively short wait time so it wasn't too bad. However, that depends on your timing. Some times of the day were very busy. \n\nInternet. It was a bit slow. So if you are someone there on business who needs fast internet for work, this may become an issue. \n\nSleeper sofa. We pulled out the sleep sofa that our original room included. For a 5 star place, there should be a nicer one. It was just your run of the mill, feel every spring, mattress. \n\nNo casino. For me personally, this was not a problem but if you going to Vegas to gamble, this may be an issue for you. \n\nNot on The Strip. The only reason this is a issue is because of the heat. If you want to go out and walk The Strip, you also have to add to that walk because you have to get from the hotel to Las Vegas Blvd. It's not too far but the heat is what does it. \n\nI may not agree on his politics but his hotel was top notch. Would recommend.","date":"2016-08-04 00:06:21"}

I think I started another review like this already, but really -- I stopped in here because the hubs and I were checking out of the Golden Nugget, and it's right past one of their checkin\/out desks.  Looks super fancy.  I thought everything would be crazy pricey (super cute + Vegas = $$$ to me), but surprisingly, their ginormous cupcakes were just $3!! And their chocolate-dipped macaroons (or sans-chocolate, same price) were ... shoot, incredibly affordable is all I remember.  AND, it's not like these macaroons were *just* dipped in chocolate either -- I saved these as a treat for myself, rather than sharing them with my friends who were celebrating the big 3-0 (I'm a fab friend, what can I say), and it was like a truffle was stuck to the bottom of those macaroons, talk about a delightful surprise!  Honestly, I don't have much experience with macaroons other than visual, but the softness and coconuttiness (not too much) were very appealing.  And back to those cupcakes -- huge.  Delicious. I got one red velvet for one friend, who shared a bite with me -- moist, tasty, cream cheese frosting was perfect.  I carted around the other two cupcakes for the rest of the trip, and only got to sample the chocolate-chocolate -- also delish.  \n\nNutshell: if you're nearby (ie, downtown), worth the stop.  Would I make a special trip downtown just for these? Despite the 4 stars, I can't in all honesty recommend the hassle it is to get downtown if you're staying on the Strip for a short time.

The first visit was a little bumpy; however they had just opened a few days before so it was expected to have some rough spots. The food was on pointe and their craft  beer game was solid during the first visit, so we decided to give them another go round.  Service was way better (since it was a Tuesday and kind of slow, our waiter was very attentive).  Again, the food (for the most part) was ah-mazing.  Beer selection has a good rotation.  I was sad they didn't have the witbier from last week, however the PB Porter from Peoria Artisan was a welcome addition.  \n\nPros:\n-PB&J Burger (I swear, try it ala mode - it's soooo good! They must think I'm a weirdo though.  Our waitress said the kitchen staff was confused by my request )\n-The fried chicken - enough to feed 2 people and the best we've had!\n-The sloppy corn bread- divine\n- The Divolono (sp?) Pizza - spicy with a hint of honey sweetness\n-CRAFT BEER!!!!\n\nCons:\n-The pretzels - 3 small pretzel \"sticks\" - maybe 4 would be a better number and they just seemed very small.  Both of our orders also were cold.\n\n-Our side of fries came in a large dish, but there were so few that it looked like we got someone's leftovers.  They were hot though, and my 6 year old seemed to like them \n\n\nAll in all, we will definitely be back.  Maybe not with our littles (they get bored easily).

Today July 15, 2012, we went back driving all the way from Peoria and arrived at 4:46PM, and the sign said, \"Hot Baguette\" yum!  We went inside ordered our combination sandwiches and some hot baguettes.  The cashier told us the all of the baguettes had sold out already but the hot baguette sign still left on.  This is false advertisement, people.  Also, the ingredients they put in the sandwiches are inconsistent, and it's franchise restaurant, seriously?","date":"2012-07-16 08:15:37"}

I am sad to see a local spot gone but the family that owns this place is cute. I feel like they just opened a place to serve food they make at home. They claim to be a Vietnamese and Chinese spot but I didn't see much Chinese except for the fried rices.\n\nIt has a typical Vietnamese menu minus the curries. I did however see they offered a beef stew with bread yum.\n\nBasically the food was good, the place was clean, and the service was polite. They could do to stop by the tables more often except to drop food off but I enjoyed all of the staff I encountered. Very sweet and friendly. \n\nWe tried their combo pho $8x 2, a ban mi dac biet $3 and some change, and their spring rolls $3. All came out to $24 and some change. We were stuffed. It was a bargain IMO.\n\nI really liked their sandwich. Their bread was hot, fresh, and crunchy. I've never had one like that. I want to say they didn't put the patte part. I have to say I didn't miss it, and I've been eating those sandwiches since my childhood. At first it looked like they skimped on meat but it was perfect. I loved it.\n\nTheir pho was good. It was a good size with a large amount of meat. The broth was good, the noodles were cooked just right, and it was served super hot. The bowl looked below average in size but it was just the right amount. I finished the whole bowl and the broth. \n\nTheir spring rolls were good. The dipping sauce was good. I enjoyed them. \n\nI have to say for a newer place I thought they did a great job. If they are reading and I could help them improve I'd say to offer straws for their water, get a napkin dispenser for the table if they don't plan to walk by too much, and lastly take their service to the next level. \n\nOverall I do plan on returning soon. In comparison to a Pho Kim Long, Pho Saigon, or Pho So 1 it is just as good but with the friendly staff you won't find in China Town.\n\nCheck them out!","date":"2015-01-04 01:13:01"}

About the size of a cocktail frank, and about as remarkable.  The lemon piece served with them was dried out. The hummus, though tasty, was VERY thick!  Almost like cutting into a soft cheese - not spreadable.  We asked for some oil to add to it and felt that that was really a just so-so solution.  I doubt seriously that it was freshly made - thinking it had been sitting around for a while.  \nOur pastitsio was ok - not very hot when served though, my guess is that it was microwaved.  Our pasta (ziti)  was the worst we've had in a restaurant ever - in that it was SO overdone.  Normally, if a dish isn't perfect , we will not ask for a replacement, but this was luke warm and SO mushy and starchy and tasteless. The server explained something that I really didn't want to know - that the pasta is precooked at the beginning of the day and then reheated ! - not cooked to order.  Our server was accomodating, but the whole experience was much less than wonderful.  While we expect ethnic music in an ethnic restaurant, theirs was so loud that after a couple times around the play list we were really quite ready to leave and had our 2nd plate of ziti (only slightly less mushy) packaged to go.  a big disappointment - glad we had a groupon.  BUT - it turns out that our server's insistance that the groupon required us to order two entrees (rather than the mix of soup\/salad and one entree we'd planned to order) was NOT true. We didn't have the groupon with us - only on my phone and I didn't look closely at it until I got home and looked at it more closely on my lap  top. SO that less than hot, overdone ziti was the dish that we actually didn't plan to order - but we had to, and that pushed our lunch order over the $30 limit of the groupon -- just an overall bad lunch experience - after a previous lunch there which was much better.","date":"2015-12-05 04:06:49"}

I was all wrong about you! I am so happy that I decided to give you a second chance, and you beyond redeemed yourself! If you read my first review I didn't have such a stellar experience, It wasn't bad per say but it wasn't what I was expecting! So, I was hoping that the second time around would be better and it was!\n\nThis time around we went and ordered another bottle of my now favorite wine Sexual Chocolate, it's a Syrah - Zinfandel blend and it's frankly to die for. The bottle runs around $65.00 and they offer it by the glass as well at I believe $16.00.  This go around we decided to order an assortment of their appetizers, and I was frankly blown away by nearly all of them. The only one I wouldn't order again would be the Spicy Tuna Pops. The tuna itself was amazing, super fresh and really flavorful. The waffle cone that it arrived in didn't exactly compliment the fish. \n\nOther items that we ordered and LOVED were the dozen oysters, we got an assortment of the oysters they had that particular day and they were fresh and this time around there wasn't a trace of shell in any of the oysters! WOOHOO!\n\nThe Crispy Cuttlefish was one of my fav items that evening - The only way to describe it is that it is very similar to calamari but frankly it's better than calamari. It doesn't have that rubbery texture to it and it was fried to perfection and the lemon aioli was the perfect compliment to it. \n\nCuttlefish's take on a wedge salad is what dreams are made of! I love wedge salads but I usually am not a huge fan of the iceberg lettuce since it really has zero taste or nutritional value to it. The bibb lettuce was a welcome change of pace and the crispy pancetta, and avocado was a nice  addition. \n\nThe pork  belly, the Carlsbad Mussels, Shrimp and grits I could just go on and on! Had the opportunity to meet Joey one of the owners who was very friendly, and I was really impressed when I learned that he actually cooks in the kitchen there. I love that he is a hands on owner and it shows that he has a real investment in the establishment! \n\nDef worth checking out if your in the mood for some fabulous seafood, and if you love oysters and champagne Wednesday's are 1\/2 priced oysters and champagne nights and they had some great live music!","date":"2014-06-11 19:47:59"}

Our Captain went over and above as he assisted us in choose the appropriate wine to pair with our culinary choices.\n\nNow.. we would come back for all of this goodness, but the Mastro's Butter Cake is one of a kind and is worth the whole meal or just to drop in for dessert after shopping.  \n\nNeedless to say & in keeping with my \"positively outrageously\" great dining recommendations, you have to enjoy Mastro's if you're in Vegas!","date":"2011-01-09 01:12:56"}

Saw an advertisement in a travel magazine, was initially skeptical. Menu online looked good, plenty of gluten free selections for my wife (easy to read, well labeled). Made a reservation online, noted that one party had a gluten allergy. Arrived early, friendly staff who graciously accepted us early (we arrived about 15-20 minutes early). Did not pawn us off on the bar, but instead asked if we wanted to sit inside or out. We picked inside. Outside had nice variety of tables and a nice open fire, great \"foody\" smell that really drew you in. Once seated, team member came over with glasses and poured water for us. Menu was great, server came over and noted the allergy and went through the menu with my with my wife and discussed substitution options. Great drink menu, good selection. Great timing of appetizers and entrees. My wife had the salmon rillettes, which were absolutely delicious. She also had the cast iron petite chicken (with mashed potatoes instead of the stuffing). Great presentation, chicken cooked perfectly, great flavors. Best mashed potatoes that I have ever had in a restaurant. I had the beckett's table signature fork tender short ribs. Also got a side of the wood oven roasted bacon biscuit stuffing. All I can say is WOW... Truly fork tender, and truly awesome. I love stuffing, sad but true. This was the best stuffing that I have ever had. Presentation was perfect, stuffing side came in a small cast iron dish. Nice little aside, there are pig figurines throughout the restaurant. When asked, learned that folks have been ending them since they opened. Awesome little thing that is fun to check out all around the restaurant. I would definitely recommend, and hope to make it back sooner rather than later!","date":"2015-10-23 14:54:46"}

The food was a tremendous disappointment and with one waitress on a Sunday night, we had to wait for just about everything.  Food was overcooked and just weird.  The fried zucchini and spanokapitos were good, but entrées were tiny and just not tasty.  For six people our bill was $160  plus tip closing in on $200 which included some desserts too.  Everyone felt the same way and although we all live nearby we won't go back.  I can get a better meal at Denny's with better service.  I give them another 6-8 months and they will be closed.

The worst I've come across in the country. I live in east and west coast.  I suffered  many times before I say it.  Besides, it takes us time to write this.\nTWC, or Road Runners ( they were the same ) was the supplier of cable internet for Earth Link (I was told later) when I called for connection problem.  TWC convinced me to change  from Earth Link to TWC.  I refused the first year for TWC's bad  business integrity.  Few years later, I had no choice as the price went up again.  So I switched to TWC. The second year, it went up that understood, after promotion.  To save trouble of payment, I set up auto- pay, this year it went up again.  I called to understand the reason.  Their customer service was so rude with a prima donna attitude.  She even insulted me over the phone as I didn't want all the services. Since I stayed for a week of less each month, it's unjustified for me to pay close to $100.  I simply kept my expenses but the service reduced to 1\/10 of the speed that I had.  I'm looking for another provider if there is. \nFor all these years, I've seen more adverse comments than favorable comments to TWC.  Most business respect prestige customers or those stay with them for years. But not TWC.  They believe customers can't live without them in Charlotte.  That's why I've seen salesmen knocking at our doors every season like the 50s to look for new customers.\nI'm sure if TWC's upper management can make a change to their customer services or change their prima donna attitude, I'm sure they will not loss customers.\nAnyway, sorry for my long comments.

I came in late and sat at the bar and ordered the Baja Fish tacos.  The bartender warned me that the plate was hot to touch, and the food was also super hot.  Had too wait a few minutes to avoid burning my mouth.  Wonder if it was popped in the microwave.  Anyway, it was a solid fish taco, I felt full after the first one, but had no trouble with the second.\nI always ask for a local brewed beer if one is on tap and I chose a Sleepy Dog Chihuahua Pilsner and was satisfied with the taste.  Sleepy Dog has a brew pub in Tempe that I will have to check out.  The bartender was friendly and atmosphere was nice for a strip mall in this arid, upscale, gated community-land.

I was prepared to be frightened and off put by a to young too hip crowd but I was more than pleasantly surprised. Windsor is a delightful venue, comfortable and spacious and pretty with an interesting menu. We had a specialty cocktail featuring orange water, rum and marmalade and it was de-lish-es.  We also had a nice brown pag chicken sandwich and a side of mac and cheese which is almost always too ironic for me but it was very tasty. All in all an excellent experience. Parking was a hassle and an annoyance-valet parking is probably the only bad thing that the owners of this place inflict on the customers (here and at the other stores they own). That said, despite the parking annoyance we will be back. I enjoyed the entire experience and my dear love was very happy. Just remember no day but today.","date":"2011-10-27 15:36:51"}

This places is straight fire! I'm not just talking about heat levels either. We got a small sampler in which we tried the fried chicken with green onion, blazing chicken on a skillet with sausages and an order of kimchi and oyster fried rice. The fried chicken was so crisp it was unreal. The meat was still moist and succulent. The flaming chicken was tasty, well-spiced and flavourful too. The sausages weren't the main event so I give some leeway on their generic processed feel. The fried rice was also excellent, a little stingy on the oysters, but to be expected. Overall I'm definitely coming back for the fried chicken - it makes a nice alternative to chicken wings and beer. Just a heads up though, don't expect late night Chinese food prices, this place isn't cheap.","date":"2016-03-07 00:13:27"}

The quality of their dumplings is stellar. I was eating and feeling grateful for that experience. It was not my first time at Casa Imperial but it was another fantastic experience.

My favorite dishes were the seafood dumplings with spinach and the fish noodles with mushrooms. Mind you that the fish noodles were not in their menu.

I have worked in specialty retail for over 20 years (not giving away my age too much) and this little gem was a good find! \n\nSmeeks has old-fashioned candies, sodas and many novelties to share with kids of any age! I loved it! They host birthday parties, offer party favor options that are out of the norm and they even have a photo booth in the store! It's a fun and exciting shop! Check it out if you haven't been! There are also two other cool stores next door. Frances is a women's men's and children's store that carries shoes, jewelry, bath and body products, gifts, toys and clothing. It is owned by the same owner as Smeeks and it is also a great store! Stinkweed's is next door too. It's a record store with a lot of soul!","date":"2012-01-03 21:22:32"}

OK that was our bad,  we told them that they couldn't do that and they stopped. We ordered another round of shrimp and the manager decided to come over to our table and instead of politely notifying us that there is no sharing, it seemed like she wanted to announce it to the other tables around us and remind us that it says that on the menu. We offered to pay for a side of shrimp if it was an issue,  but the manager just said it was OK and walked away... The conversation between the manager and the elderly man after that was not professional and was indicative of someone who did not have enough training to diffuse a guest situation. \n\nSide note: if you and any other party members order their all you can eat shrimp option you still can't share. I made sure to clearly ask the server this question to be sure there was no misunderstanding. \n\nThis rating is not because of the \"no sharing\" rule, I now take issue with the Outback Steakhouse slogan. The food was decent, but the situation should have been handled better. I have had ample customer and guest service training to know that much. I believe more training is necessary for both management and staff. \n\nThe experience was bad enough to negate anything positive about the food.

Having lived in the valley for most of my life I appreciate the sentimentality.  \n\nBUT!  It is important to separate nostalgia from reality, especially when others rely on your opinion when making dinner plans.\n\nI've lived in the Valley for a good long time- more than 40 years.  I've been to Jordan's more times than I can count.  \n\nAs a child, this was one of many local Mexican food restaurants we visited- others being El Maya, Don Jose's, Rosa's, Rosita's, George's Ole, and others.  As an adult, part of my enjoyment was the old-fashioned, retro atmosphere- the genuine Naugahyde seats, dark wrought iron, old-school environment.  I was even OK with the smooth taco sauce in lieu of chopped and chunky salsa.  I tend to stick with the old-school combo plate- taco, enchilada, tostada type combos when I visit.\n\nMy last two visits have occurred in the last year- most recently in November.  The experiences were almost identical- disappointing.  It was as if someone in the kitchen had just given up.  The taco meat was not really seasoned, very bland, and the shell tasted as if they went and picked up a package at the grocery instead of making their own.  The enchilada was rather oily.  Food was warm, not hot.  Service was friendly but scarce- my drink sat empty more than once.\n\nThe visit in November is likely my last.  I drive by this location at least 3 times a week, and remember wistfully the days when the the food was piping hot, shredded beef well seasoned and the entire taco fresh out of the cooker- crispy and delicious.   There are too many good Mexican food places in town, and even for the memories that walking into this places conjures up, I cannot see myself coming back anytime soon.  I'll keep my eyes open for an upturn in Yelp reviews, particularly from those who are trying it for the first time.\n\nAs another reviewer said- be forewarned.  You run a great risk of being disappointed.","date":"2011-02-13 22:12:41"}

Being an ASU alum, I frequented the Tempe location, and it was one of the most unique and fun bars near campus. The atmosphere in Scottsdale is similar, despite being in one of the north side's more complicated and ginormous strip centers. They've clearly taken a design tip from the Tempe spot, with brick walls, similar lighting and bar and a decent-sized patio out front (not nearly the size of Tempe's, but oh well).

The table was wobbly, but the server (busboy?) immediately got down on his knees and readjusted the ends for us.\n\nWe started out with the cheddar bites.  They were mini, dense and rather not great.  Its almost like a failure attempt at recreating Red Lobster's cheddar biscuits.  The shrimp and grits were decent, but a far cry from NOLA.  The meat and potatoes were decent, but really average if that.  The duck fat fries were actually pretty good and the only thing we all agreed was tasty.  Too bad the waiter took it away before we were done while talking to another server so we couldn't even protest.\n\nThe reasons for the 2 stars - the dishes are creative, the menu is mysterious (which is good and bad), and there was such hope there.  These were the kinds of dishes that you might see on Master Chef or Hell's Kitchen.  But they wouldn't be winners by any means.  \n\nThe place is kept COLD.

The scallops in pesto - over powering and the oil tastes stale. The octopus - grilled perfectly but the tabuleh and humus and pomegranate - too much and not well done. The tuna - served on seaweed salad....doesn't fit on the same plate as pickerel with sweet mash....very confusing and very strong flavours.\n\nBut what they do right are the classics. Great deal on Oysters - though i found the shucking to be a little poor - but when you're paying essentially $1.50 a shuck, you accept that.  The lavraki however - now this is the star of their menu. It's exceptional. No confusion - classic greek prepartion - the gril, some salt, some lemon and olive oil. The protein sings and the grill accents. \n\nMy honest recommendation - just go for some oysters and lavraki and you'll have an excellent night.

It was definitely a bit more than I'd usually pay for trays of meats, cheeses, and the like, but I chalked this up to a wedding expense and didn't think much of it.\n\nCome the day of the wedding, I was happy hitched and getting photos taken when I get a call \"Hi, this is SoAndSo from Metcalfe's and I have a delivery.\" \"Yes,\" I say. \"I'm the bride and I'm not there. There are 2 planners on site as well as venue staff.\" \"But I'm at the back door and no one is here. I have a delivery,\" says Metcalfe's dude. \"I'm not there! I've just gotten married. I'm having my pictures taken. Please just go knock on the front door. There are a bunch of people who can help you.\" \"Yeah, I went to the front door, but it says {the venue} is closed for a private event.\" *FACEPALM* Now I was annoyed. \"YES! And YOU ARE BRINGING THE APPETIZERS!\" I then just snapped a bit and told him to sort it out and that I wasn't to be bothered.\n\nLater (perhaps 20-30 minutes later) we parked our car at the venue for more photo taking and the delivery van from Metcalfe's was just leaving. I got a dirty look.  When I later spoke to the person managing the venue for our reception, he had a laughable mention about the delivery guy as well. Clearly the dude was not a people person and very confused about how to deliver to an event (as opposed to a person's house, etc.).\n\nThe food was good, but didn't have labels as to what it was. I'd asked about this and was told it would have. So our very expensive platter of Wisconsin artisanal cheeses and dried fruits and such didn't get eaten as much as it might have. That thing was *not* inexpensive. I was a bit miffed. \n\nAll in all, the appetizers from Metcalfe's were delicious. But the service was ridiculous.","date":"2012-11-06 17:29:26"}

Ambiance is lovely and rustic. The concept is terrific (farm to table), too. The service--I had a very professional and friendly mid-aged man--was also very knowledgeable and attentive. One of my party (a visiting professor) put up a mild huff about how the wine \"not being cold enough\" (something my cheap ass would probably let go from the get-go), but he handled it with aplomb. We got multiple dishes, including a cheese and bread tray, eggplant parm, some sort or cheesy kimchi thing, and another kind of braised beef. All were fresh and mouth-watering to the eyes. And the wine selection was fantastic. My only complaint--and it's enough to knock off a star--is that the food was just to darn salty. You had to drown out many of the dishes with the extra bread on the table. It's possible most of V Picasso's regular patrons like their food on the extra salty side, but I as well as my other dinner mates agree that you couldn't eat too much of the food because of the salt content. So that was a big disappointment, particularly given that everything else was spades. So if they can just cut back on the salt, maybe they're be on the track to 4 (hell even 5 stars) in my book. But until then... one can only hope and wait.","date":"2017-10-24 20:00:38"}

You just have to know where it is.  Also when they are clearancing out merchandise, the price will end in a \"1\".  Most common is .71 or .81.  I have picked up 5 pound bags of mixed candy for .71 a bag, and lots of other deals just by knowing this little secret.\n\nThey do discount their meat the day before they need to pull it from the shelves.

Both locations are awesome depending on what you're looking for.\n\nWe came here for dinner last night and sat at the patio to watch the game. Honestly I feel like The Vig has one of the best nachos ever. Everything in their nachos is quality - we always like to add shredded chicken.

It wasn't overwhelmingly tasty like other mac and cheese dishes. The pasta was cooked perfectly and served in an iron  skillet. You can order their burgers or sandwiches and upgrade your side to a mac and cheese or pozole for just $3. So worth it! My boyfriend always orders the pozole. I am not a fan of pozole in general but The Vig makes it so well. \n\nFor drinks, our server misunderstood my order and gave me a Four peaks peach ale instead of the AZ peach shandy. She took the drink off our bill when she realized her mistake but I actually liked the four peaks peach ale more so than what I ordered. I wasn't a big fan of the AZ peach Shandy and would probably not order it again. \n\nThe service is always great at the Vig. They also have complementary valet.","date":"2017-10-11 02:47:19"}

This is a review of just the front office staff.  I was asked to come to my 10:15 appointment 30 minutes early to fill out the necessary me patient forms.  I arrived 55 minutes early.  Provided my ID and insurance card then day to complete my ppwk.  After I finished I went to turn it in.   The girl in the front glanced at it and told me(rather rudely) I had to fill out the insurance portion.  I said to her that I thought that was why they took a copy of my card.  She gave me a funny look and said you have to fill it out.  I took the forms back and walking away I muttered.... that's a pain in the ass.  After completing them I handed them back to her and she said they'd call me.  About 10 min later I was called by a different lady to pay my Co pay.  As I was talking to the new lady the ride one interrupted our conversation by saying that I'm not allowed to swear in here, that kind of language isn't permitted.  Lol I'm sure I looked at her crazy because honestly I had forgotten that I even said anything since it wasn't directed at her.  I asked what I said and she said you called me a pain in the ass.  I told her I want talking to her and that comment was more to myself.  She replied with you're not allowed to talk like that.  At this point I'm getting irritated because I honestly wasn't talking to her and I had explained that,  so I told her... generally speaking if I were going to ball someone a pain in the ass I would look them in the face and straight up tell them that they are a f#%#ing pain in the ass.  Then I sat down.  Needless to say, this was not the best 1st impression they could've made on me.","date":"2015-05-26 17:42:41"}

I had a particular design in mind this visit which included some intricate straight lines. \nThe technician tried her best to draw the lines, but I was surprised the tools that she used, instead of a thin brush like I have seen used in other salons I've been to, she used a bulky thick brush. So all the lines came out thick, uneven, and wavy. I didn't really like it, but it was late and I didn't want to make a fuss. After a day, the lines really started to bother me, so I called to see if they would fix it being that I was charged $14 for design on 4 out of my 10 nails. On top of the manicure being $10 more than other salons, $14 for design, and leaving a 20% tip, they told me, they would charge me for fixing the nails. It's not about the money, obviously I spend money to get me nails done. It's about the lack of customer service that they offered. Think twice before going to this over priced salon that lacks good customer service and just wants your money. \n\n\nThanks for actually responding on Yelp. However, it would've been nice to actually get this over the phone when I called, instead I was told there was nothing you could do, except charge me. The lines were thick and wavy, maybe you need to look closely at the picture to see that. As far as your 7-day policy, I called the very next day, so I'm not sure how that's comes into play. \nI ok'd the design cause we were already 2 1\/2 hours in and like I said prior, I didn't want to make a fuss. \nMy problem wasn't with the tech, she did a great job, besides the lines. My problem was with the management  not caring that I was displeased with my nails after 1 day and after dropping $70 in their salon. \nThey treated me like I was trying to get something for free. If they had said, why don't you come in so we can take a look. Who knows I probably would've paid to get it fixed. But they didn't want to hear my side of the story. I love having my nails done, and always receive compliments on them daily. In turn I love to refer folks to the salons I visit to so they too can have that experience. But the way I was treated at this salon was unnecessary, so I had to address it. I wish The Nail Room much success.","date":"2016-01-30 02:19:51"}

I was quickly seated, ordered the half regular, half spicy hot pot, and went to gather my food while the broth came to a boil. \n\nI was very impressed with the variety, especially the seafood: 3 different types of crab, scallops, clams, mussels, and even lobster. Not sure if the seafood variety is like this every night or I just happened to visit on a special day. A selection of noodles, vegetables, and meats (beef, chicken, pork, and lamb) rounded out my choices. Each of the refrigerated items were portioned out on Styrofoam plates and wrapped in cellophane, which I thought was a little wasteful. In the center of the restaurant were a bunch of desserts and some cooked items such as fried rice, pad thai, etc. The theme of the non-refrigerated items was thai. As mentioned by others, there was also a condiment\/sauce section.\n\nBoth broths were fine. The spicy broth was not that spicy and did not cause any numbness, but nor was it very oily. The meats were just okay, very lean, so they ended up a little tough after cooking. The lamb (a classic) and beef (eye of round?) were my favorites. I am not a huge crustacean fan, especially if I have to shell them myself, but I did enjoy the shellfish. The desserts were okay, nothing special. The meats could have used a little more marbling and an extra waitperson would have helpful.","date":"2014-11-30 00:00:05"}

I ended up throwing the Whole $15 \"Rib Dinner\" away. This is my opinion and first experience with the restaurant food.","date":"2016-09-18 15:27:48"}

Honestly, some people might not be excited about the \"inconvenience\" about ordering multiple times but I'm happy with it because I've oftentimes wondered and reflected about the waste! Also, the waiters\/waitresses are so attentive that anytime you need anything, they're right there to take your order. Furthermore, they do all the cooking for you, so all you need to do is eat.

They wash was a bit expensive ($1.50 for the small washers), but the dryers were cheap and effective (20-30 minutes per load at 25 cents per 10 minutes). \n\nMy biggest knock against them was the general cleanliness of the place. The level of dirt on the counters and floor indicated that it hadn't been cleaned in a few days. This is not what you want when you are trying to clean and fold your clothes. It shouldn't take more than 15-20 minutes to clean the place each day, and would make for a drastic difference.","date":"2014-07-13 17:11:18"}

I have been going to this location for over 20 years and the line never moved as slowly as it did today. There were very few people in line when I walked in but it was quite a while before anyone asked for my order. Both the people in front of me and behind me in line commented they had also never seen the line move so slowly, and they were also long-time customers.\n\nI tried to figure it out since I counted five staff members on the line; one on the grill, one handling drinks and shakes (which left her just standing there most of the time), one putting the condiments on the orders, one at the register, and one handling the fries and onion rings. The only thing I could think of was the staff was new. One person looked vaguely familiar but other than that I didn't recognize anyone, and another person said \"I've never seen these people before.\" The employees weren't horsing around; everything just moved very, very slowly.\n\nBecause I drove in from so far away I hung in there until I got my order, but if I lived closer I would have been long gone.  I don't like downgrading my initial positive review but I think management needs to be aware they have a customer service issue--at least they had one today around 6:00-7:00 p.m.\n\n......................................................................\nTed's in Tempe has been a favorite of mine since the early 90's.  Though currently residing in Queen Creek, it's worth the trip now and then for a delicious, charbroiled jumbo all beef dog.  So many places come and go, but it's great that Ted's has been at the same location for years. Hope they remain for a long, long time.\n\n11\/8\/09: Found myself at Ted's again today [along with a few other times since posting this review].  Same great dogs, and this time got the fries and onion rings--so good. Same quick service too. So glad to see their business is booming during these less-than-great economic times. Long Live Ted's !!!\n\n01\/07\/2014 - Ted's still delivers the goods. Since I live in San Tan Valley now (we formerly borrowed Queen Creek's name) I don't get out there often, though have been there a few times since the last update). Today I ordered the jumbo all beef, fries and onion rings, as always--and as always, it was delicious. Thanks Ted's!","date":"2008-04-30 07:47:27"}

People were enjoying their beers and engaging in conversations that you could easily hear.The service was good as usual. I got the mushroom and chicken pizza, which is served on the same kind of bread as their Souvlaki. In fact, the chicken Souvlaki and my pizza tasted exactly the same when I added the Tzatziki sauce. The pizza was very so-so, and the toppings were so loose on the bread that I had to eat it like a sandwich. In comparison to the North York branch, the patio is the only bonus.\n\nWhat I like about Moxie's is that they cater to every taste.

We booked online which was fairly easy. It was really a bummer that they only allowed us 15 minutes before our jump time to set up our room. The party room upstairs was set up nicely but we did have lots of decorations to put up so that took some time away from me being able to experience what Gravady had to offer. In between setting up and checking people in throughout the party I was only able to jump with the kids for less than 5 minutes before it was time to get back to the party room. The attendant we had was very helpful in serving our guests and cleaning up spills\/messes. Everyone really enjoyed the experience and for many it was their first time going to Gravady. It is kind of pricey for just one hour especially when guests show up late and have only 30 minutes to jump. To offset the cost we made our own food so the fact that they let you bring in basically whatever you want really helped. The facility was very clean and bigger than I expected.. the only weird thing is that the jumpers either go barefoot or have to purchase gravady socks at $4 a pair. I'd much rather have the socks become a requirement and pay the price instead of thinking about all those dirty feet all over the place. The only suggestion I have for the staff is to think about how they can streamline the check in process or make is easier so that the host of the party doesnt have to run back and forth to check people in. And maybe space out party times by 30 mins instead of 15 so that we have enough time to set up and are able to enjoy the facility with our guests. Other than that, everyone had a blast and im sure they slept soundly that night also!","date":"2015-11-18 20:20:15"}

I showed up 10 minutes early. The stylist I was told would be styling that day, rudely informed me she was a level 5 stylist with a full client list and any stylist in the salon could do a good job. I should have walked out then, but I didn't. I told myself, \"let's give the stylist a chance.\" I came in with my hair done as I always wear it, I explained exactly what I needed and wanted as well as showed the stylist pictures.

Well, the kind of party that involves food, that is.\nBefore we begin, let me educate you on the pronunciation of this place - read \"Verst\". And its exact English translation is non other than sausage (figures). This recently opened spot in the heart of King West has been successfully luring in lunch crowds. With its sausage hall concept, breadth of sausage styles and flavours and an impressive local and imported beer menu; Wvrst has quickly become a favourite in the area and the Friday lunch go-to place for most of us.\n\nTheir dedication to the core product, sausages; its one to admire. All sausages are freshly made on the premises and cooked when ordered. When you arrive at Wvrst, you right away notice a large line up of people (mostly men...I did say it was a sausage party) staring at the menu, asking the staff for advice and at times drinking beer while waiting in line. Because this is a sausage hall, once your food is ordered, you are given a number which then lets the waiters know which table to bring the food to. One thing you will notice is that because the line-ups are long, the waiters are extremely diligent in cleaning up the tables, so don't feel like they are rushing you, they are just doing their job and are very pleasant.\n\nNow, lets talk about the product. From the list, my favourite is the Venison style sausage. Given that its flavour is more on the smokey, nutty and hearty side, it makes it a great pairing with just about any topping. You can choose 2 out of 4 toppings - Caramelized Onions, Sauerkraut, Sweet Peppers and Sautéed Jalapeños. The roll used to wrap these juicy meats around is something worth mentioning, being on the rather soft side, this roll is lightly sweet with a hint of sourdough style bread, a great choice. Note to reader: you can also order a whole wheat roll and choice of veggie or chicken sausage options.\n\nAnother one of Wvrst's hits is their Duck Fat Fries. Fried in duck fat as opposed to regular oil, the fries tend to be softer and buttery, while maintaining a great consistency on the surface. How this is done? A two step frying process. Double-dipping is what I would name this frying method. The outcome? Buttery and flavourful french fries. \nBut the goodness does not end here, on top of having great tasting fries, Wvrst offers you a selection of dipping sauces. My favourite, and one that I can not live without, the Mojito sauce. Dip your fries in it or add it to your sausage party, either way you in are in for a heck of a tasty treat.\n\nUntil next time Foodies!\n\nBuen Provecho,\nViviana.","date":"2011-09-25 23:16:05"}

I looked down the street and pointed. \"DEAGAN'S!\" And sorry, I have a hard time believing that even Melt's super-hyped grilled cheese sandwiches could have lived up to our perfect lunch at Deagan's. Sometimes things really do happen for a reason, right?\n\nI really wanted the barbecue pork, but I also really wanted the pork belly brussels sprouts, and I knew I couldn't possibly devour both at lunchtime. Our waitress insisted that I absolutely NEEDED to try both, and took it upon herself to ask the kitchen to make me the barbecue pork appetizer from the dinner menu instead of the entree from the lunch menu. I've never actually liked brussels sprouts that much (it was the promise of pork belly that lured me in, of course) but these were seriously good. I guess I've just never had them cooked right--super tender and drenched in butter. Least healthy vegetable ever, but also maybe the most delicious. The barbecue pork on a jalepeño pancake was awesome too, but the brusselsprouts were lifechanging.\n\nOh, and the beer selection here is interesting and varied, just like the menu. Our waitress enthusiastically brought us samples of anything we even pointed at on the menu before we could attempt to refuse them.

Various coupons\/discounts are available for sauce which we used on both visits. Groupon $18 for $30 was used on the first visit and Yelp deal $50 voucher for $25, which was found on the Yelp app, was used on the second visit.\n\nOn our first lunchtime visit, we were sat in the bar area and I took the recommendations of our server Bernadette. For the appetizer, we had the pepperoni stuffed fried cheese. For entrees, my wife had the California panini and I had the Italian chimichanga. The common thread with our appetizer and my entree was the mix of pesto cream sauce and the tomato based marinara and arrabbiata sauces. I didn't think that was a good pairing. I might have the fried cheese again but without the pesto cream sauce. I wouldn't get the chimichanga again. There's too many ingredients (meatballs, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, mozzarella, and feta along with the arrabbiata and creamy pesto sauces) that just didn't meld well together.\n\nOn our second visit, we were seated on a Saturday night with one other table in the dining room. We ordered the kids fettuccine alfredo, the sauce sea bass (they were out of sea bass and salmon was substituted), and the create your pasta consisting of fettuccine, signature red sauce, meatball, roasted garlic, and mushrooms. If you're a garlic fan and not looking for any kind of make out session after dinner, order roasted garlic with your pasta. There were a total of about ten cloves of garlic in my pasta. For dessert, we had the zeppoli which was probably the best dish of the meal. Even with the lack of business, service was still slow. Everything was OK with this visit with nothing being bad, but nothing being that memorable.\n\nThe menu is large with a mix of traditional dishes and different creations so it's highly probable to find something of your liking. We just didn't score with either of our visits. I'd come back here if we had a discount or deal as we did with our previous visits and maybe we might find the dish that is right for us.","date":"2015-10-08 06:25:15"}

Just hearing about it from friends and reading reviews on Yelp made it that much more exciting. It's a very nice place, nice drive up entry and lobby, nice interior decor. It puts you in the mood for a nice relaxing dinner. Our server this night was Keith and he was very knowledgeable, prompt and patient. He explained everything from how the meal would be served, from the salad to the actual carving of the prime rib. You don't have to be concerned if you aren't sure what the various cuts of meat are. He said that when the chef comes table side he will show you the actual sizes. \n\nOkay. First off, you get your drink orders filled, then you start off with your salad when you are ready. The salad is prepared table side on a cart with a large bowl in a bed of ice. The server proceeds to spin the bowl and tosses the dressing into it. They have a house seasoned pepper to put on your salad which is made by Lawry's. Very good and refreshing.\n\nNext comes the main course... The prime rib! Yours truly opted for the Diamond Jim Brady cut, medium rare which has the bone in. It' s actually not that big of a serving when you consider that the bone is in. I think it was a 16oz cut. It was done perfect and I had it with the creamed spinach. Mashed potatoes come with it and the au jus is laddled onto your prime rib. Oh, and don't forget the Yorkshire pudding!  Also, my dining companion and I decided on a sizzling plate of mushrooms which were sautéed in butter and garlic. \n\nAs for dessert, well, that was far from my mind at the time! It was a very delicious and satisfying meal. If you decide on coming here for dinner, I suggest you have just a light lunch that day, I did and I'm glad I prepared myself for dinner!

However, they do not tell you that even AFTER you ask for options on how to pick up your vehicle. Instead, they hold your car for an additional 3 days and charge you $30 a day simply telling you that it's not their job to provide you with  truthful answers to the questions you've asked. Great job DV TOWING, robbing the public and generating gain on the back of this cities residents. I will be going a step further and reporting them. I've already forgiven them but I hope that they will experience financial consequences for their poor business practices. As a public we deserve to deal with trustworthy companies, no matter what their occupation. No wonder their ratings are so low!","date":"2016-12-19 19:45:56"}

The place is designed to look modern, but the place is overall dim, so you can't really notice anything negative or positive. Overall look is average.\n\nService here was impeccable. Even with a full house and people constantly coming in and out of the restaurant, I felt my table had 2-3 dedicated waiters at our beck and call. However, not everyone there speaks chinese though. Regardless, our plates were changed, soups were served into bowls, teas refilled, and fast paced service. The food just kept non-stop. Definitely top notch service for a chinese cuisine place, and a chain at that. \n\nMy table ordered the 8 person combo, at $238 with green onion rolled pancake with sliced pork, 2 extra orders of Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings with Ground Pork, and Steamed Soup Filled Dumplings with Dried Scallops, Pork & Luffa. The combo included, 5 variety cold dish, fish maw soup, peking duck with lettuce wrap upgrade, broccoli and eggs, leg of a pig, seafood veggie mix, steamed fish, mushroom greens, and lobster e-fu noodles.\n\nLet's start off with the extra sides. The steamed dumplings are definitely good. Not as good as Xiao Long Bao that opened up just down on huntingwood, but still better than most places. The green onion pancake with sliced pork is definitely top notch. I find most places skimp on the green onion, the sauce, or\/either the amount of pork. This place got it just right!! I was honestly expecting subpar food since this place was a chain, but a lot of the items were above expectations. The ones that shone the most were definitely the 5 variety cold dish taking first, broccoli and eggs taking second, and peking duck takes the third.\n\nThe cold dish honestly surprised me, it is usually too cold, making it lack flavour or too hard\/chewy to have good texture. This one was bursting with flavour, moist and appetizing. The eggs within the broccoli is usually tame, but this one made my eyes go O_O, \"what is this?\" I typically don't care for this dish, but this was unique. It was strong, but not too salty and it didn't require any vinegar at all. Peking duck taste third, since there was ample meat in each slice, and the mix with the lettuce was crispy and refreshing!\n\nAll pictures attached, and definitely recommend people come try, as this chain restaurant is better than some traditionally opened chinese restaurants!","date":"2015-10-17 04:59:49"}

After this experience we looked on the floors and bed and saw at least 4 bugs running across the room and sheets. If that wasn't exciting we noticed cockroaches, beetles, and god knows what else crawling down through the walls and bathroom. Without exaggerating we killed at least 30 bugs and spanning from all sorts. They offered to move us to a different room but at that point we wanted nothing to do with the room.  The one positive of this whole experience was the lady who helped us out at the front desk. Extremely nice and apologetic. I wish I remembered her name.

The owner, Lubka, told us it was the only Portuguese restaurant in Las Vegas.  \n\nWe were brought rolls and our drinks came quickly.  We ordered several starters to share.  First was a half chorizo that was cooked with red wine and flame grilled tableside.\n\nNext, we had the dish Halloumi, goat cheese grilled over cypress and served with a sweet and sour sauce. \n\nNext came the snails cooked with a chardonnay white wine and garlic sauce and broiled with mixed cheeses and served with some toast slices.\n\nNext was Bacalao, a dish made up of salted cod, mashed potatoes, garlic, onions, eggs and extra virgin olive oil and served with a salad of mixed greens.  Lubka (Luby) told us how they treated the salt cod daily with whole milk to remove the saltiness of the cod so it wasn't overpoweringly salty.\n\nThen onto the chicken Trinchado.  The chicken is marinated in red wine and grilled.  It's then put in the Trinchado sauce which had a nice paprika flavor and a small hint of cumin.\n\nThen we had the Calamari curry, a bowl of nicely cooked calamari in a curry sauce that didn't hit you up front but had a nice curry tang after the fact.  It was quite good.  With the calamari, we got rice and a container of chutney.  The flavors complimented each other nicely.\n\nWhen we thought we had no more room, Luby insisted we have some dessert.  We went with the tiramisu.  It's quite a different looking dish from common tiramisu.  The  ladyfingers weren't like most tiramisu but there was a wonderful chocolate and \ncoffee flavor in the ladyfingers and the mascarpone cheese made this a wonderful ending dish.\n\nService was outstanding for the two hours or so that we were there.  We asked that the dishes not be brought out all at once and they did one at a time.  Luby came to the table and asked if it was OK to start the next dish.  She explained the dishes when she brought them and she was an absolute joy!  She's very proud of her food and she has reason to be proud!  \n\nThis was a very memorable lunch with good company, good conversation, excellent food, and outstanding and very pleasant service.

The system originated with one man, Imi who developed it in the ghettos of Europe pre WWII and later fine tuned it in Israel. It is used by military, law enforcement and similar organizations worldwide. \n\nThe \"Tribe\" is truly like family led by the ever vigilant and innovative Donavin Britt. Real life scenarios (ie disarming a knife\/gun wielding attacker, plucking away a choke hold, getting OFF of the ground, getting to safety after thwarting an attack, etc) The instructors are all top notch and are truly interested in each student being the best he or she can be. \n\nClasses usually start with drills ranging from sprinting\/suicides outdoors, to calisthenics to the point of exhaustion, Crossfit and even sledge hammers taken to giant tires out back. You work HARD here. \n\nKrav Maga isn't about mastering a fancy kick: it is about identifying a threat, neutralizing it and getting to safety. Though you are taught to break free from being pinned on ground, etc the focus is on being on your feet. This is not grappling.  \n\nPeople of all ages from children to older adults benefit from this system. After training for a while, you can test for Fight Class which involves an all day series of everything you've learned up to that point amped up. Again, instructors and students alike support one another throughout the process as they do in class and beyond. \n\nDue to a bad concussion, I'm unable to participate in most of the Krav activities and I really miss it. Being empowered as a woman (or man) and having confidence that you can defend yourself and push past self imposed limits is an invaluable gift Donavin, DC and all of the instructors provide. Plus, it is a great stress reliever to kick & punch tombstone pads and all of the off the hook drills they dream up. \n\nI'd recommend this school to anyone who wants to learn the practical techniques and add new challenges to their fitness regime. Truly miss the Tribe and hope to be among them again, soon.","date":"2012-06-25 23:54:52"}

Even better the second time when I made it shaggy (and I usually hate cole-slaw). The tiki dog is good too, but I think my favorite is the shaggy lava. My boyfriend usually gets the island dog (and I usually eat some of it) which is great! The chipotle garlic mayo and maui mustard cannot be easily replicated!\n\nThe tots are always cooked perfectly. I had a Horchata shave ice which didn't really taste Horchata-y, but it was yummy.

Couple that with their own hype machine of  \"our medium is VERY HOT\", the running competition of who can eat the most, etc, and really, I expect something better than a standard mass-market-pub chicken wing.\n\nWhat I got is a standard mass-market-pub chicken wing.  Juicy meat, sure, but way too much sauce* left the wings soggy.  I want some crispness to my wings.  Were they tasty?  Sure.  Are they worth over a buck a wing?  I'm not so sure.  Factor in their overpriced crap-domestic beer and mediocre fries and I'm left with little reason to go out of my way to visit the place.  Anyway, on to specifics:\n\nI call a huuuuuge BS on their heat claims.  If I had known how run of the mill their \"Hot\" was, I would have instead ordered \"Superhot\" or \"Death\".  As a consumer, I find that misleading and disappointing.   \n\nI've been a hot aficionado since I was ten years old.  I feel more pain biting into a jalapeno (3500-8000 Scoville) than I did eating ten of their \"hot\"... a jalapeno is practically a fruit!  I didn't even have to blow my nose or clear my throat, nor did I touch my beer until after the meal.\n\nListen, I get it, marketing is king... but c'mon.  At least try to back it up!  \n\nI'm a bit sad to do it, but Duff's clocks in at an underachieving 2 stars.

The fact that I'm from out of town clearly means I won't be a regular here, so he didn't have to go out of his way. It was unfortunate my food was late but unlike the servers who answered the phone & casually just said my order wasn't placed, then handed the phone to the manager because they didn't want to deal with me, the manager going out of his way to make sure I was happy really stood out to me.

It's basically lamb's brain wrapped in a crispy salty bacon wrap. It sounds crazy but the brain is very light and has the texture of cream-cheese.

I felt the flavouring needed more work.. But that's just my opinion. Some of my friends said it was good and others felt the same as me.\n\nBeen here a few more times (this is the only Asian style bar food on Main St). The food, in my opinion did get better. Can't wait till summer to come here with friends and just sit on the patio to drink beer and eat skewers while checking out Main Street!! Will definitely be back and recommend to others.\n\nOverall experience is good, Korean waitresses are hot!!\n\nNice place to throw darts, watch sports on tv, and chill out on Main Street!!!\n\nOnce summer comes around, I'm sure the smell and sight of the lambs skewers will just sell itself!!!\n\nSuper happy they have this type of food on Main Street now!!

BUYER BEWARE!!\n\nI placed an order with vitacost.com on 10\/12\/14 and I was very excited when they shipped it out that very night and received a \"delivered\" the very next day! I went to get my mail at the leasing office and they never got my package, in fact it is Memorial Day and no mail, no packages. I found that to be strange, so I said that my package says that it was signed for by a Robert E. and they claimed that no Roberts are employed.  So I called the neighboring leasing office and they said the same thing... weird. SO I called Ontrac and they claim that the driver delivered it and I should have it, just go to Robert E. I explained that we have no such person.  So her bright idea was \"oh just call vitacost.com maybe they will issue you a refund or replacement.\" I said \"I tried them already, since you said it was delivered, I am S.O.L!\" and she then decided that she will ask the driver what happened and call me back. *Right like the driver is going to say \"Yeah I lost her package, my bad.\" \n\n2 days later I get a call back, she says \"The driver says he placed it at the leasing office and it is there now.\"  I put her on hold and with my 2nd line I called my leasing office and nope sure enough, not there.  SO I asked her to have the driver call me when he is there so I can prove it to you all that you're at the wrong property.  The lady told me that she can't do that. But she will contact him again and call back. \n\nThe next day, I get another call from Ontrac, this time they say that the driver is adamant that he placed a door tag on my unit number and left the package in the leasing office.  So I said \"ok that sounds ok if the driver is lying out of his a$$!\" She said \"He swears.\" I said \"I would like you to tell me... do I have an apartment number on my address?\" She looked and said \"Um, Oh, Um, No... there is no apartment number listed.\"  I then said \"Then how the Hell did your driver leave me a Door tag???? He didn't, because your driver is a LIAR, since I know for a fact that my leasing office wouldn't have given him my apartment number!\" She said she would call him and then call me back. \n\n2 days later: I get another call, now from a completely different person, trying to sell me that last bit of garbage from the previous call, about the door tag nonsense.  She then decided that she would call me back. \n\nAfter 3 more days of no contact, I decided I would email them a letter of \"WTF happened to my package!\" I am still waiting for a response. \n\nHowever I did get a refund finally from Paypal.com of all places! I opened a claim and stated my case and they sided with me.","date":"2014-10-27 06:16:49"}

I am always serviced by Robert, who is the only good thing at this place and he will soon see he is simply too good for the people he works for.\n\nOne day, I decided to try the blow dry bar. I had a great experience with a nice girl. I then called to schedule another appointment with her and did not remember her name, so I referred to her as the white girl and then there were two other African American girls who work there.\n\nThe girl that I usually saw was not there this day, so I asked if they had any other people working who weren't the African American girls because I thought they only did hair cuts and African American girls hair.

I am the one PAYING!\n\nI tried scheduling an appointment for my massage about a week later and the owner Scott gets on the phone and calls me racist and tells me that he does not want me to return to the spa. WOW! He then said he would call me back that day to talk further. He never returned my call. I had to physically go there and have the receptionist call him to give me a call. Talk about unprofessional. \n\nI never wanted to cause any problems here, but Eva, the owners wife, has not once acknowledged my existence when I'm spending thousands and thousands of dollars at her spa!

Now I'm here to tell the truth about the sick minds behind this business.\n\nThey rail people in with their promotions and then when you go to pay, they only will accept one gift card per transaction. Do not waste your money at this place. They are frauds and make false accusations.\n\nAlso, the owner said he just fired an employee for making racial comments.

I despise everything about Kinko's. I don't even know where to begin. Buckle in, this is bound to be long winded.\n\nOnce upon a time, I thought Kinko's was this magical place full of neat machines and free paperclips that was constantly full of cool projects and was hopping twenty four hours a day. Then I began to need to use them for my job, and that's just when all the trouble began. First of all, very few Kinko's, if any, are even open twenty four hours a day anymore! But that was just the initial crack in their facade for me. See, I used to be able to just email them a document as an attachment, and put instructions in the body of the email. Then I would follow up with a call to make sure they got the file, which they always did. They would tell me over the phone when I could pick it up, and the orders were always on time. \n\nTHEN everything changed. They no longer accept email orders. They have created the most complicated and horribly bass-ackwards program on their website to upload documents. I understand why they did it, and I'm not saying it's a bad idea. I'm just saying the program needs some major overhauling because it never ever ever EVER works right. Either I can't explain what I need to them through their structured questions, or it won't upload right, or the submit button doesn't work. Then, once I finally get it to work, I have to call them 20-30 minutes later. Generally, they still haven't received my file by my first call. So I call back. I'm left on hold forever, and when they return, they still have to ask a billion questions about my order because their system doesn't tell them what they need to know. It takes virtually forever.\n\nI really feel for the employees at Kinko's. I once worked for a copy shop, and I know how hectic things can get. That being said, I have never witnessed more incompetent help in my life. I don't blame any of the individuals that work there, Kinko's probably just has provided very little useful training for them. But still, I dread going in there. Even to simply pick up a completed order, it will take no less than 30 minutes.\n\nOn top all of that, Kinko's is expensive. Needlessly so. Simply because they have a stranglehold over the copying business gives them no right to charge those ridiculous rates for various services. Blow it out your a$$, Kinko's!","date":"2007-05-20 00:52:34"}

The concept is good, but the execution seems flawed. I don't really know what i was expecting - I guess that the sausage would taste a lot different from a cheap BBQ'd Toronto street food hot dog - it really didn't. They might be home made and (possibly) one would assume nitrate free, but they didn't taste that much different. Even the hot dog buns are the same as the ones you get on the street (i.e. the exactly the same - yes, that cheap-ass bread that goes soggy the moment any moisture hits it). Surely a gourmet hot dog deserves at least a home made gourmet bun to go with it? We had two hot dogs. They both came with a rather nasty creamy coleslaw that doesn't really work too well in a hot dog. A portion of fries was greasy and soggy. Tastier sauerkraut can be found in the supermarket.\n\nService was fine and friendly - the place wasn't busy. However, they will need to move faster when there is a rush on.  The drinks on offer are actually more appealing than the food - very decent and surprisingly varied beer selection and home made sodas.\n\nSo onto value - with tax these hot dogs are pushing $10 a piece (some are over that). Are they 3x better than some of the hot dog vendors on the street? No. More importantly - would we recommend this place or be going back? - unfortunately not. \n\nOverall just really disappointing. I know it is the first day, but there are some fundamental misses here on the taste side of the house - the service was fine. We had high hopes for this concept, but I think we will stick with the gourmet burgers for now.","date":"2013-05-29 01:14:47"}

Two two-meat platters (comes with two sides), one pulled pork meal (one side), 3 drinks and tip was $56~\n\nRibs and brisket were decent, not the best, but better than most. I make ribs at home, so I'm super picky about these.\n\nMy wife and my dad both said the pulled pork was excellent. I thought their BBQ sauce was original and very tasty. I assume they're making it in house and that it's not a commercial restaurant product.\n\nMac and cheese was ok, with a good flavor but the texture was off. It was quite mushy. My wife loves green beans and she said they were really good. I had collard greens and these were cooked perfectly. I'm used to them being cooked with smoked meat for flavor. These were not, but were still tender and nicely seasoned.\n\nPortions are the right size.\n\nI think we stopped in like 30 minutes to closing, so that could explain the Mac and Cheese.\n\nReally nice people running the place, were welcoming and courteous.","date":"2017-07-08 19:35:11"}

After looking up several area furniture stores online, I found a great-looking bed at Rooms to Go Furniture's website, so my wife and I decided to visit the store.\n\nRooms to Go has a very attractive showroom and is designed to appeal to the visual senses. Rooms to Go specializes in modern style furniture, unlike many of the other, more conservative, furniture stores in the immediate area. If you are looking for a more hip, modern look, Rooms to Go is where you want to start looking.\n\nWe were helped immediately by our salesman upon entering the store. He was able to locate the bed I was interested in and assisted me in finding the appropriate mattress for it as well. I ended up purchasing a matching chest of drawers and end table. \n\nWe were assured that all the items were in stock and would be delivered on 2\/29 to our home. The delivery people arrived on time today and had the entire bedroom assembled within 40 minutes. They were extremely professional and efficient.\n\nI plan to make Rooms to Go my place to go for any other furniture we may need. We will be in the market for a sofa or chairs coming up and this is definitely where we will begin our search.","date":"2012-03-01 03:38:53"}

We arrived around 12:30, and the place was not super packed but obviously busy. The decor was sparse but nice and fairly modern. We were greeted twice promptly, and told we'd be seated momentarily, which we were. Free chips and salsa were delivered -- my companion noted that the chips seemed like Doritos without any of the cheese or Cool Ranch flavoring on them, as they were perfect triangles and there was nothing special about them. The two \"salsas\" that came with the chips were flavorful but super watery, with no chunks of veggies or even any thickness to them -- when you dipped your chip, liquid just ran off and nothing stuck. Blah. Our server (not sure of his name -- on the receipt, it only said \"Server\") had the personality of a wall: not friendly, barely smiled, and had no recommendations whatsoever. We each ordered a margarita, and were asked if we wanted a small ($6.50) or large ($9.00). When we asked about the size difference, he couldn't explain it with either words (ounces) OR his hands (???) so we decided to just try the small size. VERY disappointing -- the glass was FULL of ice cubes, and I literally think I took about five medium-sized sips before it was gone. Also, it tasted mostly like water, with very little lime flavor and clearly less alcohol. For $6.50 it was a MAJOR ripoff. On to the food. Between the two of us, we ordered the tableside guacamole, one plate of three tacos, and one plate of a tostada and a taco. The tableside guacamole was made by a VERY sweet and friendly woman (maybe one of the owners?) who chatted with us through the making of it -- her bright personality was pretty much the only redeeming part of the whole meal. The guac was yummy, and we loved that it was customizable (you got to choose which of about six extra ingredients were mixed in), but it was made with only a single avocado and a few mix-ins and not worth the $8.49 price tag -- we were not even offered any extra chips beyond those already served with our \"salsas.\" When the tacos and tostada were delivered, I was shocked: my friend's tostada was a normal size and looked tasty, but the tacos were TINY, maybe 4\" across (at least 2-3\" less than a \"normal\" corn tortilla). The filling was decent (I ordered one steak, one campechanos, and one pastor), but nothing to write home about. Our server checked in with us a few times during the meal, but made it seem like it was an inconvenience for him, plus never took any of our empties off the table or asked me if I wanted a second margarita (perhaps he couldn't see that it was empty due to ALL THE ICE STILL IN THE GLASS). He gave us our check before we were even done eating, and rushed us out at the end of our meal (even though the place was nearly empty by then) which was quite disappointing. I can't recommend this place, and I won't be back.","date":"2018-03-23 17:04:25"}

The decor and service were great especially for an after work rush.  Although, it is truly a verbatim Happy Hour that ends at 6pm.  Not the biggest fan of a short happy hour, but I understand that Downtown doesn't draw the same volume of people after work as Tempe or Scottsdale.\n\nWe decided to sit at the hightop bar so we could get a great view of the place.  It's a very open concept with a nice view into the hustling kitchen and outward view of the US Airways Center.  Great urban vibe.\n\nThe food is where it fell a little short. The Salmon sounded great with farro, fennel, and roasted apples, but didn't live up to it's $22 price tag.  Portion size was decent, but nothing outstanding about the flavor.  Maybe my time in NYC has spoiled my taste buds.\n\nOur bartender was also a bourbon drinker and recommended the Candlestick Maker.  She made a great drink.  I tried the Turkey Sloppy Joe feeling that the poblano peppers would pair well with the bourbon, but should have trusted my gut and figured that the sloppy joe was probably part of the kids menu.  Could really use some more zest and kick.\n\nOverall, it's a nice addition to CityScape and will definitely try to make happy hour again.\n\nOh, the Artichoke Hummus was the best part of the night.

I ordered one of my favorite burgers, a bacon guacamole six dollar burger.  I got it to go with a side salad and a small drink ($7.89 as a combo).  I should have known something wasn't quite right when my order was up faster than I could fill my drink at the fountain.  The meat was very well done and not very hot.  A burger choice that is normally very messy to eat with guac and meat juices and such running all over the place was sorta dry. And even picking the burger up in my hands it felt cool.  The side salad was OK.\n\nThe bright spot in this was the staff.  I was greeted before I could get to the counter by everyone except the cook.  And on my way out I was thanked for coming in by the manager and two other staff.\n\nFast food is nice but if by getting really fast the quality goes away you haven't gained anything.

What went from 6 people turned into 11 amazing group of friends going to dinner together. Midi is relatively small and cozy bistro but the staff handled our large group very well. The Winterlicious menu was only $25.00 and I would say you definitely get your dollars worth. \n\nAs a starter I had the Salad Midi which was nice and light way start to my meal. It was made with mixed greens, prosciutto, asiago cheese, dried berries & pesto drizzle.  But of course, I had to steal from others plates as well. The Crostini was superb as well! For the main, I decided to go with the Fettuccini with Black Tiger Shrimp, Atlantic Salmon, Mussels, Roasted Red Peppers, Baby Spinach in a Rose Sauce. I was slightly disappointed with the main. I wish they had made the salmon and red peppers into bigger pieces instead of blending it into the sauce. The Black Tiger Shrimp was amazing and fresh though. For dessert I had the Profiteroles which is Choux Pastry with Vanilla ice Cream & Hot Chocolate Sauce. It was my first time trying Profiteroles and I have to say I didn't enjoy them as much as I would have liked to. The Choux Pastry tasted somewhat like soggy pancakes because the ice cream was melting and the Hot Chocolate Sauce tasted like store bought chocolate sauce. There was nothing special about it.  \n\nOverall, I had a fantastic time at Midi. The service was fantastic. The washroom was kept clean. The portions were great. Definitely will go back but this time with a smaller group or just a romantic date! ;)","date":"2014-02-05 20:43:08"}

Damn Holler & Dash, I tell you what, there's some magic going on behind that counter. I guess I should elaborate!\n\nAround here is where I'd typically insert the obvious hollaback one liner. I'll yield to the other reviews, you beat me to it! When you walk in, the warm, natural interior design makes you feel very welcome. Good use of several elements such as stone, timber, and an exposed ceiling give the whole dining area a spacious atmosphere. When I visited Saturday morning it was very clean and ready for a big rush.\n\nSpeaking of rush, if you want a calm visit then make sure you stop by as early as possible (they open at 7am every morning). The place fills up very fast. Fortunately they have a TON of staff on hand to handle to the heavy hours.\n\nMy first visit I tried one of the signature biscuits: Chicken Set Go! There was a bit of a sticker shock on the price at $9, however once you get it, you'll see that this is no ordinary biscuit. First of all, it's HUGE. I mean the top half of the biscuit is larger than the whole of what you'd get at most places. This particular creation had moist, seasoned fried chicken topped with pimento cheese, pickled jalapeno, sorghum, and served with a side.\n\nIt's a winner! Wow, that chicken tho. The chicken was moist, and had the right concoction of spices. Perfectly breaded and fried right on the money. Just the right amount of crunch for a best-case biscuit. Pimento cheese provided a delicious creaminess and the pickled jalapenos the right amount of sour astringency to redline all of my tastebuds. Who knew a biscuit could be this complex, yet all come together to make the breakfast of your dreams? What I thought was overpriced at first all the sudden had a ton of value in size, taste, and presentation.\n\nThe cheese grits were very good. A lot of \"Southern Breakfast\" places around here give you a bowl of grits that look almost watered down, for me the thicker the better and here they do it right. Very well seasoned too, which is not always a gimme when it comes to grits. The kitchen staff has really proven themselves with my breakfast.\n\nThe only problem for the rest of my day was that I was ready to take a nap about 20 minutes after eating this!

I ordered a small pizza I got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. \n\nI looked forward to getting some great pizza man this place really disappointed me today.","date":"2013-12-29 00:09:17"}

I would not say it's our favourite restaurant for lunch, but it's definitely our default when we want an Asian fusion joint with a quiet atmosphere. There is a lot of natural light that streams into the small space during their operational hours, so that most likely contributes to this too, mood-wise. \n\nIts concept is nice: western cafe meals (eg. Pastas, casseroles, fries, etc.) with a Japanese twist. \n\nEven though I have a penchant for Japanese fusion cuisine, this cafe falls flat. When I first went here the servers were attentive and the food had a more memorable flavour. Now, the servers never swing by at all. Some may like this, but when one expects bottomless coffee to be refilled, this doesn't sit well. After receiving your food, don't expect servers to even look at you again (the two servers were too busy talking to each other near the cash register). I heard that there is a revolving door of workers here, so this may be why the staff seem less professional than I remember.  As such, be warned about the bill: I asked for split bills, but one waitress said that wouldn't be possible unless we paid in cash, whereas on my second attempt another waitress had split the bills for us without question. The food was nothing special either. I got the crab rice casserole, which hardly had any crab meat at all and which  tasted like a casserole from any corner HK style cafe.","date":"2017-06-28 00:37:25"}

Instead, I was going to try to find someone to drive my car and transport it for me to my new location. When I thought about it, I felt like it was going to be such a hassle and I would feel bad asking someone to make a long drive for me. Thankfully my cousin told me there were companies that actually transport cars so I searched around my area for transportation service and found Pheonix Auto Shipping. I was hoping the workers wouldn't be awkward and I was very happy once I met them. They were very nice, they loaded my Range Rover and Escalade (two very big cars) professionally and I felt comfortable allowing them to transport my cars. Thanks for all the help guys!","date":"2016-12-04 07:28:06"}

(this is a staple for us every week).  Wasn't looking for great...just decent. Unfortunately, our first experience was disappointing as we ordered two classic dishes: Pad Thai and Spicy Fried Rice ....Pad Thai is a dish that should be consistent in flavor, regardless of where you order it..this dish had a flavor that was not consistent at all with the dish and was quite bland (was ordered at a medium spice). On the contrary, the Spicy Fried Rice was over powered with flavor, but it was unfortunately too much sodium and soy sauce...and pretty much inedible.  Based on the other reviews, it may be worth trying again, but quite frankly, with so many other strong and consistent Thai restaurants within a 10 mile radius, it's likely we'll make the trek down the hill for the sure thing.","date":"2016-10-26 21:03:31"}

While the patio and dinning room were packed, the bar seats in front of the wood\/stone oven were open! Who wouldn't want to watch them artfully craft delicious food? I could have sat there alone and been completely entertained. Instead, the staff dazzled my family and I as we relaxed and perused the menu. \n\nAs far as service goes, I left over a 20% tip if that gives you any indication of how our meal went. I prefer bar service. I don't like the over-attention of being seated in dinning rooms and served. At the bar I always feel like I'm getting a more genuine experience without being suffocated. The gent at Humble Wine Bar did a great job of exactly that--great, quick service without being bothered. He took our orders, offered some feedback and even had a witty comeback for dad, who often loves teasing our servers at restaurants. My mom spilled her beer on her entire pizza and despite insisting she didn't want another pie, he put in an order and didn't charge us. Like I said, great service.\n\nMy dad loves wine and pizza, which is a big reason why we came here--but mostly the wine. He enjoyed the two glasses of red he had and compared them to the varieties he had tried on his recent trip to France. I also enjoyed the rose cava and the red I tried. But really, any restaurant or bar that offers great sparkling wine or cava by the glass is awesome in my book. \n\nWe ordered the margherita and soppressata pizzas to share. My mom tried the house salad and my dad and I split the caprese with prosciutto. Both the salad and caprese dish were delicious. Where some felt the house salad fell short without adequate dressing, we found it perfectly dressed. All the flavors of the spicy greens paired with the currants were present without the dressing taking over the entire dish. And there was no trace of the overuse of oil. I often make vinaigrettes at home and find a lot of restaurants do them wrong. They are actually more oil than anything else, but must be properly emulsified to taste balanced. The caprese was awesome with thick slices of house-made mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes and a light drizzle of balsamic reduction. The dish also came with two hunks of freshly baked bread and a mound of some of the best prosciutto I've had in a long time.  The pizzas were perfectly cooked right in front of us in their 800+ degree wood stone oven. The crusts were perfectly bubbled and chewy without being too thick or thin. The sauce was well-balanced and you could taste their house-made mozzarella melted on top. \n\nSomething tells me I'm going to have a hard time convincing my family to try any other restaurants next time we have plans to eat out in Lakewood.","date":"2015-05-26 11:57:15"}
